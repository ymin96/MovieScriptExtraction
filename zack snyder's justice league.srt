1
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:09,586
Alert the queen.

2
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:30,606
Hyah!

3
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:03,151
Bruce Vayne.

4
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:04,935
Bruce Wayne.

5
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:24,389
Talk.

6
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,479
I believe there is a stranger.

7
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:30,265
Comes to this village
from the sea.

8
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:33,137
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.

9
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:35,531
He brings fish.

10
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:37,315
He comes on the king tide.

11
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:38,665
That was last night.

12
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:47,587
You have eyes, so see.

13
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,545
Icebergs in the harbor.

14
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:52,722
It's four months since
the last ship got through.

15
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:56,857
Well, this stranger
doesn't come by ship.

16
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:07,476
There are enemies
coming from far away.

17
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:10,479
I need warriors.

18
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:14,178
This stranger,
others like him.

19
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:18,618
I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.

20
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,621
It's very important
that I see this man.

21
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,146
If this stranger exists,

22
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,365
he'll give him your message.

23
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:28,758
$5,000 American.

24
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:30,717
Look, I'll give you $25,000

25
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:33,720
to talk to this man
right now, outside.

26
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:50,780
How dare this dog
speak to us like children.

27
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:54,566
Ooh, magical man from the sea.

28
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:57,569
We are poor, not stupid.

29
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:59,441
Get out.

30
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,096
I'm sorry.

31
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,880
Can't do that.

32
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:06,143
I'll leave after we've spoken.

33
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:12,323
He said, "Get out."

34
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:33,301
Arthur Curry.

35
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:36,173
Also known as
Protector of the Oceans.

36
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:38,523
The Aquaman.

37
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:46,009
So, let me
get this straight.

38
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:49,621
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

39
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:51,449
Worked for 20 years in Gotham.

40
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:53,495
Oh, that shithole.

41
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:55,453
When the fight comes,
we'll need you.

42
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:58,152
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

43
00:11:58,326 --> 00:12:00,304
'Cause I don't like you coming here,
digging into my business

44
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:02,809
and getting into my life.
I want to be left alone.

45
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:04,767
Is that why you do this?

46
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:06,397
Why you help these people out
here in the middle of nowhere?

47
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:07,683
I've read the stories.

48
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:09,859
Your good deeds
you think no one sees.

49
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,513
You'll join us.

50
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,384
"Strong man
is strongest alone."

51
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:15,082
You ever heard that?

52
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:16,605
You ever hear
of Superman?

53
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,302
He died fighting next to me.

54
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:21,088
My point exactly.

55
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:23,394
He believed
we were stronger together.

56
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:25,135
We owe it to him.

57
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:27,529
I don't owe anyone anything.

58
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:37,844
Dressed like a bat.

59
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:39,759
You're out of your mind,
Bruce Wayne.

60
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:09,544
Move over, Dusty.

61
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:08,559
My God, Master Wayne,
but this is cold.

62
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:13,086
Maybe we can catch
the next king tide in Jamaica?

63
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,479
Might be
a metahuman or two in Fiji.

64
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:17,264
Costa Rica's nice.

65
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:18,830
I found him.

66
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:24,053
He said no.

67
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:26,229
So the draft stands
at naught for two?

68
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:31,495
Maybe a man who broods
in a cave for a living

69
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:35,064
isn't cut out to be
a recruiter. Hmm?

70
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:56,520
That's $10, please.

Jerry, hi.

77
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:39,955
Wow.

78
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,348
You don't miss a day, do you?

79
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:44,742

Move!

86
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:46,255
Move it! Move it!

87
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:55,221
- No, mate, don't shoot!
- Move, move!

88
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:56,831
Get the fuck
over there!

89
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:00,356
Move! All of ya!

90
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:12,977
Line them up
along the wall.

91
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,893
Keep them quiet.

92
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:18,331
- Keep quiet!
- Shut up! Shut up!

93
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:19,854
Shut them up too!

94
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:25,512
We'll be making
a statement shortly.

95
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:27,557
Until then,
if I see any movement,

96
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:29,603
you'll have a lot of dead kids
on your hands.

97
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,272
Should I take him?

98
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:47,969
Hold your fire.

99
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:50,619
They've got kids in there.

100
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:54,323
Yeah,
he's not bluffing, chief.

101
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:56,630
St. Brigid's had
a school trip today.

102
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:22,525
Quiet! Shut up!

103
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:29,967
Down with the modern world.

104
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:31,621
Back to the Dark Ages.

105
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:38,106
Quiet!

106
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:42,763
I said
shut your fucking mouth.

107
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,735
Who are you?

108
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:01,608
The Lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

109
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:04,480
Now, who are you?

110
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:07,614
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists

111
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:09,442
who wanna turn back
the clock in Europe

112
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,835
- a thousand years.
- Boring. Why the hostages?

113
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,620
We have no demands.

114
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:15,467
We're just stalling the police
while we do it.

115
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:17,188
While you do what?

116
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:21,192
You're too late.
The countdown's already begun.

117
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:24,718
In a few minutes,
four city blocks...

118
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,939
...while the world watches.

119
00:23:08,735 --> 00:23:10,040
No!

120
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:11,738
Like lambs
to the slaughter.

121
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:02,528
I don't believe it.

122
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:03,702
Believe it.

123
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,176
Is everyone all right?
Are you okay?

124
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,570
Good. It's okay.

125
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:46,789
It's okay. It's over.
You can stand up.

126
00:24:46,963 --> 00:24:48,269
It's all good.

127
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:50,184
It's over now.
Are you okay?

128
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:52,491
You okay? Good.

129
00:24:58,192 --> 00:24:59,410
Are you okay, princess?

130
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:04,633
Can I be like you someday?

131
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:09,464
You can be anything
you want to be.

132
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:13,686
Come on. Let's go.

133
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,773
Any changes today?

134
00:25:57,947 --> 00:25:59,383
No, my Queen.

135
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:03,039
The Mother Box has awoken,

136
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:06,129
yet nothing has happened.

137
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:08,305
It has slept
for thousands of years

138
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:10,438
since the First Age.

139
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:11,874
Why did it wake at all?

140
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:21,623
This is the first time
it's gone quiet

141
00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:23,016
since the crack appeared.

142
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,758
Maybe it's going
back to sleep.

143
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:31,590
Evil does not sleep.

144
00:26:32,547 --> 00:26:34,505
It waits.

145
00:26:35,985 --> 00:26:37,857
Something is coming.

146
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,559
Prepare for battle!

147
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,761
Amazons,
on your marks!

148
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:14,197
Ready!

149
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,442
Defenders.

150
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:47,709
They have failed
100,000 worlds.

151
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:49,319
They always fail.

152
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:56,022
I've come to enlighten you
to the great darkness.

153
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:59,025
I will bathe in your fear.

154
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:03,029
Daughters of Themyscira,

155
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:05,988
show him your fear!

156
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:08,512
We have no fear!

157
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:29,403
Gather the legions!

158
00:28:30,404 --> 00:28:31,535
Go with her!

159
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,059
You must seal the cage!

160
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:35,365
- Go!
- Phillipus!

161
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:03,219
No!

162
00:29:15,884 --> 00:29:16,885
Behind you!

163
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:22,325
Ahhh!

164
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:25,502
Epione.

165
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:29,463
Honor us. It's right.

166
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:33,772
Seal it.

167
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:41,605
Ready the hammers!

168
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:56,011
Seal it now!

169
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:32,151
Guard it with your life.

170
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:34,085
- Yes, my Queen.
- Keep it moving.

171
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:35,458
Hyah! Hyah!

172
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:00,587
Hyah!

173
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:21,624
Got it! Go!

174
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:24,192
Hyah!

175
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:48,695
Oh, noble Queen.
Why do you fight?

176
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:53,569
You can't save her.

177
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:56,137
You can't save any of them.

178
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:03,753
The great darkness begins.

179
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:05,581
Amazons!

180
00:35:15,852 --> 00:35:18,420
Yes, we will find the others.

181
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:22,816
Draw!

182
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:26,428
Loose!

183
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:26,184
He's gone back
to his universe.

184
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:27,358
No.

185
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,320
He's gone to the lands of men

186
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:35,671
to find the other two boxes.

187
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:38,892
We have to light
the ancient warning fire.

188
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:42,504
The fire has not burned
for 5,000 years.

189
00:36:42,678 --> 00:36:44,158
Men won't know what it means.

190
00:36:45,028 --> 00:36:46,378
Men won't.

191
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:49,555
She will.

192
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:22,936
It's toxic.

193
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,807
That's good.

194
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:47,003
Go!

195
00:37:47,177 --> 00:37:49,136
Follow the scent
of the Mother Boxes.

196
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,877
Find the missing two.

197
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:54,924
Once they are found,
The Unity will be formed.

198
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:57,797
This world
will join the others.

199
00:37:59,755 --> 00:38:01,757
He will be pleased.

200
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:04,804
He will see my worth again.

201
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:09,287
Hey.

202
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:11,985
Anything on that kid
from the liquor store?

203
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,552
Possibly.

204
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:16,598
"Possibly."

205
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:19,340
If I had a dollar
for every "possibly."

206
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:22,082
Yeah, it would make you
even more insufferable.

207
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:27,783
Facial scan might have
got a hit on him,

208
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:30,264
our disappearing man.

209
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:35,138
One Mr. Barry Allen
from Central City.

210
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,618
Might be
another false positive,

211
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,228
you'll have to give me
a little time

212
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:40,535
- to confirm.
- We don't have any more time.

213
00:38:42,276 --> 00:38:44,060
Master Wayne,

214
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:46,454
you've been working
as if there's no tomorrow

215
00:38:46,628 --> 00:38:47,716
to build this team

216
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,718
of people you can't even find.

217
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:52,025
I found one.
I found two, including Diana.

218
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:54,201
Just because Lex Luthor says

219
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,159
the planet's
in danger of attack?

220
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,292
This has nothing
to do with Lex Luthor.

221
00:38:58,466 --> 00:38:59,815
It has to do with him.

222
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:03,993
I made a promise to him
on his grave.

223
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:07,301
I spent a lot of time
trying to divide us.

224
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:10,870
I need to bring us together
and make this right.

225
00:39:11,044 --> 00:39:13,699
Well, it's been some time
since Luthor's warning.

226
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:18,094
No attacks.
No barbarians at the gate.

227
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:21,576
Maybe these barbarians
don't use a gate.

228
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,361
Maybe they're already here.

229
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:29,105
Keep looking.
What else do you have?

230
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:09,711
Lab's all yours, Howard.

231
00:40:09,885 --> 00:40:11,452
11:30.

232
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:12,975
Early night for you, Silas.

233
00:40:13,149 --> 00:40:15,717
Yes, early night.

234
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:17,091
Tell your family I said hello.

235
00:40:52,362 --> 00:40:53,929
What the...

236
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,978
Jesus.

237
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:15,054
The Arrow of Artemis.

238
00:42:15,228 --> 00:42:17,665
It will reach
the lands of men.

239
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,676
Sky torch,

240
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,373
hero beacon,

241
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,288
scatter the darkness.

242
00:42:32,462 --> 00:42:35,640
Burn as you burned
in days before.

243
00:42:37,293 --> 00:42:41,080
Show her the darkness before
the daylight of history.

244
00:42:41,254 --> 00:42:44,779
Warn my daughter
that war has come

245
00:42:46,215 --> 00:42:47,869
and protect her.

246
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:14,896
Return to me, Diana.

247
00:43:53,587 --> 00:43:56,372
What did you do
this weekend, Diana?

248
00:43:56,546 --> 00:43:58,810
Nothing very interesting.

249
00:43:58,984 --> 00:44:01,464
That's all you ever tell us.

250
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,120
What can I do?
I'm not that exciting.

251
00:44:05,294 --> 00:44:09,211
You might as well disappear
when you walk out of here.

252
00:44:13,563 --> 00:44:14,564
Again?

253
00:44:14,739 --> 00:44:16,828
- What is it?
- Now what?

254
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:20,135
Budget cuts, tomb raiders.

255
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:22,747
Now add to the list "arson."

256
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:26,533
Yes, good morning

257
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:28,424
From the isle of Crete.

258
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:29,947
As you can see behind me,

259
00:44:29,971 --> 00:44:32,060
an enormous bonfire
is burning.

260
00:44:32,234 --> 00:44:34,323
This fire has been burning
through the night.

261
00:44:34,497 --> 00:44:35,934
We're now into the morning

262
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:38,284
and we are
at least five miles away.

263
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:41,809
And we can still
see it burning as we speak.

264
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:44,986
This has baffled locals and
government authorities alike

265
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,988
here at this historical site

266
00:44:47,162 --> 00:44:49,687
of the so-called shrine
of the Amazons.

267
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:51,752
Now, locals and government
officials are baffled as to

268
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:53,691
- what may have caused this.
- Invasion.

269
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:04,049
Ryan.

270
00:45:04,223 --> 00:45:05,528
- Hiya, Doc.
- Is the...

271
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,661
No damage
to the electron-laser.

272
00:45:07,835 --> 00:45:09,837
- Uh, Dr. Silas Stone?
- Yeah.

273
00:45:10,011 --> 00:45:11,839
- Ryan Choi?
- That's us.

274
00:45:12,013 --> 00:45:14,233
Um, who did this?
Did they steal anything?

275
00:45:14,407 --> 00:45:16,017
They took
whatever was in here.

276
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:19,891
That? Oh, that wasn't stolen.
Was it, Dr. Stone?

277
00:45:20,065 --> 00:45:22,850
No. That was misplaced
a while ago.

278
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:26,767
Object 6-1-9-8-2. Department
of Defense Archives.

279
00:45:26,941 --> 00:45:29,030
- Mmm-hmm.
- What was it?

280
00:45:29,204 --> 00:45:30,204
I don't know.

281
00:45:30,336 --> 00:45:31,816
You don't know?

282
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,750
I don't know, which was why
I was studying it.

283
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:35,558
What's your rank, Doctor?

284
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,691
Ryan, would you, uh,
do the honors?

285
00:45:37,865 --> 00:45:39,475
- Sure. Okay.
- Thanks.

286
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:41,956
Civilian. STARLABS
is a private contractor.

287
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,262
We work for the DoD.

288
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:46,221
We advise them
on xeno-science.

289
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:47,875
"Xeno-science"?

290
00:45:48,049 --> 00:45:49,790
Alien technology.

291
00:45:56,971 --> 00:45:59,060
For example,

292
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:00,758
the Superman ship.

293
00:46:09,114 --> 00:46:10,506
Eight people

294
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,354
never signed out
of the lab last night, Doctor.

295
00:46:12,378 --> 00:46:13,596
Cleaning staff, guards,

296
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,598
a few of
your research scientists.

297
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,774
They were abducted.

298
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,341
Are you sure?

299
00:46:19,515 --> 00:46:21,909
Witness saw it all.
He escaped.

300
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:25,130
He's here in quarantine now,
working on an ID sketch.

301
00:46:28,176 --> 00:46:32,485
Any idea who
or what that might be?

302
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:54,637
The box
isn't safe here.

303
00:46:57,205 --> 00:46:58,728
Victor,

304
00:46:58,903 --> 00:47:01,166
they came looking for it
at the lab.

305
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:05,692
People were taken by some kind
of monster or something.

306
00:47:08,477 --> 00:47:10,349
You know a lot about monsters,

307
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:12,438
don't you?

308
00:47:18,879 --> 00:47:21,534
Especially how to make 'em.

309
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:25,152
Mayday! Mayday, mayday!

310
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:30,070
My hull is breached.
I'm going down.

311
00:50:35,423 --> 00:50:37,425
Mayday!

312
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,601
Is there anybody out there?

313
00:50:44,998 --> 00:50:46,043
Ahh!

314
00:51:19,946 --> 00:51:21,556
Whiskey.

315
00:51:30,435 --> 00:51:32,915
Tell him to respect
the storm next time.

316
00:51:42,142 --> 00:51:43,142
It's on him.

Son of a human father
and Queen of the Seas.

331
00:54:17,689 --> 00:54:19,473
All the time I've wasted

332
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:22,607
trying to keep the promise
I made to your mother.

333
00:54:24,783 --> 00:54:26,219
Are you finished,
old man?

334
00:54:26,393 --> 00:54:28,613
You never sleep
in the same place twice,

335
00:54:28,787 --> 00:54:31,442
yet you keep coming back here.

336
00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:35,446
I like it. It's quiet.

337
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,404
It's your inheritance.

338
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:39,624
You're the rightful king
of Atlantis.

339
00:54:40,842 --> 00:54:41,930
Our people suffer.

340
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:44,106
Your people.

341
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,806
A brutal, petty,
superstitious race.

342
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,156
Is the surface any different?

343
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:52,289
Nobody calls me
King of the Surface.

344
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:55,509
What do you want, Vulko?

345
00:54:55,683 --> 00:54:57,003
Guards near
the stronghold

346
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,556
have been disappearing.

347
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,122
Snatchers from above.

348
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,559
Talk to King Orm.

349
00:55:01,733 --> 00:55:03,387
- Your brother?
- Half-brother.

350
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:06,477
He's trying to fan the flames
of war with the surface.

351
00:55:06,651 --> 00:55:09,393
He lies.

352
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,569
The snatchers have come
from the dark place.

353
00:55:11,743 --> 00:55:14,223
They're looking for it.

354
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:18,532
The Mother Box
our people guard is not safe.

355
00:55:18,706 --> 00:55:21,013
Go to the stronghold
of Atlantis.

356
00:55:21,187 --> 00:55:22,623
Protect the box.

357
00:55:23,711 --> 00:55:24,843
The time has come.

358
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:28,977
Take up your mother's trident.

359
00:55:40,249 --> 00:55:43,862
You can't turn your back
on the world forever, Arthur.

360
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:47,779
Above or below.

361
00:56:17,025 --> 00:56:18,592
DeSaad.

362
00:56:18,766 --> 00:56:22,640
DeSaad! I call to thee.

363
00:56:31,823 --> 00:56:36,915
Steppenwolf,
have you begun the conquest?

364
00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:40,092
This world is divided.

365
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:41,746
They are a primitive species.

366
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,226
Unevolved and at war
with one another.

367
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,273
Too separate to be one.

368
00:56:47,447 --> 00:56:49,667
Their free will
must be ripped from them,

369
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:51,669
like the other worlds.

370
00:56:51,843 --> 00:56:55,977
Given absolution
in one glorious belief,

371
00:56:56,151 --> 00:56:57,805
to serve him.

372
00:56:58,632 --> 00:57:00,982
The Mother Boxes?

373
00:57:01,156 --> 00:57:04,072
I have found one of the three.

374
00:57:04,246 --> 00:57:06,684
The one that woke
and called to me.

375
00:57:06,858 --> 00:57:08,381
The other two still sleep,

376
00:57:08,555 --> 00:57:12,341
but the parademons
feel their presence.

377
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:14,126
They fly,

378
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,782
they search, they take
prisoners who carry the scent,

379
00:57:17,956 --> 00:57:22,743
while I build a stronghold
in the name of his glory.

380
00:57:23,352 --> 00:57:25,224
Yes.

381
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:30,359
Mighty Steppenwolf,

382
00:57:30,534 --> 00:57:34,842
who might have sat here
by the side of the great one.

383
00:57:36,801 --> 00:57:41,327
But undone by his self-pride.

384
00:57:42,546 --> 00:57:43,895
DeSaad...

385
00:57:45,026 --> 00:57:47,986
I fall before you.

386
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,944
Let me make a plea to him

387
00:57:50,118 --> 00:57:52,033
that I may come home

388
00:57:52,207 --> 00:57:54,993
after I take this world
in his name.

389
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:57,517
You betrayed him.

390
00:57:58,997 --> 00:58:00,477
Your own family.

391
00:58:00,651 --> 00:58:02,870
I saw my mistake.

392
00:58:03,044 --> 00:58:05,656
I slaughtered those
who sought his throne.

393
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:10,835
You still owe the great one
50,000 more worlds.

394
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:14,142
He will hear your plea

395
00:58:14,316 --> 00:58:16,493
when you pay your debt.

396
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,499
The Mother Boxes
will be found and united.

397
00:58:23,456 --> 00:58:25,589
No protectors here.

398
00:58:25,763 --> 00:58:29,201
No Lanterns, no Kryptonian.

399
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:32,944
This world will fall,
like all the others.

400
00:58:34,032 --> 00:58:35,729
For Darkseid.

401
00:58:38,993 --> 00:58:41,169
For Darkseid.

402
00:59:02,495 --> 00:59:04,366
You know,
I paid millions of dollars

403
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,064
for this building's security.

404
00:59:06,238 --> 00:59:07,848
You got
your money's worth.

405
00:59:08,022 --> 00:59:10,372
Took me almost a minute
to disable it.

406
00:59:11,939 --> 00:59:13,201
Hi there.

407
00:59:14,899 --> 00:59:15,900
A new toy?

408
00:59:16,857 --> 00:59:18,946
Prototype troop carrier.

409
00:59:20,687 --> 00:59:22,210
I once knew a man

410
00:59:22,384 --> 00:59:24,822
who would have loved
to fly it.

411
00:59:24,996 --> 00:59:26,693
The best minds
at Wayne Aerospace

412
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:27,912
couldn't make it fly.

413
00:59:29,043 --> 00:59:30,610
But you can?

414
00:59:30,784 --> 00:59:32,481
I have no choice.

415
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:35,397
I need more range
and I need more cargo.

416
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,356
I think
there's an attack coming.

417
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,271
Not coming, Bruce.

418
00:59:40,098 --> 00:59:42,666
It's already here.

419
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,668
From what I've learned,

420
00:59:44,842 --> 00:59:47,366
they are things
from another universe.

421
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,890
They serve a dark power.

422
00:59:50,064 --> 00:59:51,762
An old power.

423
00:59:51,936 --> 00:59:53,285
What do they want?

424
00:59:53,459 --> 00:59:57,506
To invade.
To conquer.

425
00:59:57,681 --> 01:00:01,815
They came here once before,
long ago.

426
01:00:07,038 --> 01:00:09,475
A great armada
appeared in the sky,

427
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:12,304
laying waste
to all who opposed it.

428
01:00:12,478 --> 01:00:16,525
The leader of the invaders
was a being called Darkseid.

429
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:21,661
A name cursed and feared
in every universe.

430
01:00:21,835 --> 01:00:25,622
Darkseid was met in battle
by Earth's defenders.

431
01:00:25,796 --> 01:00:28,755
The old gods, men...

432
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:31,932
Atlanteans before
their descent into the sea...

433
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:38,330
Amazons before their betrayal
and enslavement

434
01:00:38,504 --> 01:00:40,854
and guardians from the stars.

435
01:00:41,028 --> 01:00:42,856
Their histories
had taught them

436
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:44,597
not to trust each other,

437
01:00:44,771 --> 01:00:46,947
not to hope for an alliance.

438
01:00:47,121 --> 01:00:49,080
To fight apart.

439
01:01:38,216 --> 01:01:40,871
As Darkseid
waged war on Earth,

440
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:42,481
he found a secret there.

441
01:01:42,655 --> 01:01:46,398
A power hidden
in the infinity of space.

442
01:01:46,572 --> 01:01:48,226
He called forth mystics

443
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,359
who worshipped and controlled
three objects...

444
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:52,709
the Mother Boxes.

445
01:01:52,883 --> 01:01:54,275
Wait, wait, wait.

446
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:55,537
"Mother Boxes"?

447
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,758
Indestructible
living machines,

448
01:01:58,932 --> 01:02:01,456
made from a science
so advanced,

449
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,850
it looks like sorcery.

450
01:02:04,024 --> 01:02:06,635
To conquer, three boxes
have to synchronize

451
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:10,074
and join together
into The Unity.

452
01:02:10,248 --> 01:02:13,294
The Unity cleanses
a planet with fire,

453
01:02:13,468 --> 01:02:17,037
transforming it into a copy
of the enemy's world.

454
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:20,649
All who live
become servants of Darkseid.

455
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:23,783
Alive but drained of life.

456
01:02:23,957 --> 01:02:25,263
Parademons.

457
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,570
Amazons!

458
01:02:34,446 --> 01:02:36,143
With me!

459
01:03:05,564 --> 01:03:08,001
But before The Unity
could synchronize,

460
01:03:08,175 --> 01:03:10,134
the defenders of Earth
attacked

461
01:03:10,308 --> 01:03:11,962
and fought as one.

462
01:03:12,136 --> 01:03:15,139
Amazons alongside Atlanteans.

463
01:03:15,313 --> 01:03:16,967
Zeus and his son Ares

464
01:03:17,141 --> 01:03:20,666
alongside the guardians
from the sky.

465
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,887
A golden Age of Heroes
fighting together

466
01:03:24,061 --> 01:03:25,453
to defend life on Earth.

467
01:05:22,179 --> 01:05:24,964
They did what no world
had ever done.

468
01:05:25,138 --> 01:05:27,184
Sent the enemies
back into the stars.

469
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:33,494
The three Mother Boxes
never synchronized.

470
01:05:33,668 --> 01:05:36,802
The Unity never came to pass.

471
01:05:36,976 --> 01:05:39,674
But, in their retreat,

472
01:05:39,848 --> 01:05:42,982
the boxes were left behind
on Earth.

473
01:05:43,156 --> 01:05:46,812
They grew weak.
Dogs without masters

474
01:05:48,683 --> 01:05:50,250
falling asleep,

475
01:05:50,424 --> 01:05:52,905
awaiting their return.

476
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:55,386
Fading from the view
of the enemy,

477
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,693
anonymous
among a trillion worlds.

478
01:06:15,623 --> 01:06:18,975
The defenders of Earth
made a vow.

479
01:06:19,149 --> 01:06:22,413
Men, Atlanteans, and Amazons.

480
01:06:22,587 --> 01:06:24,371
Each would enshrine and guard

481
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:26,504
one of the three
sleeping Mother Boxes

482
01:06:26,678 --> 01:06:30,160
according to the rites
and rituals of their culture

483
01:06:30,334 --> 01:06:32,989
in case a box
should ever wake again

484
01:06:33,163 --> 01:06:34,773
to call out
to the planet Apokolips

485
01:06:34,947 --> 01:06:36,688
to return and conquer

486
01:06:36,862 --> 01:06:40,605
the only world
Darkseid had ever lost.

487
01:07:56,594 --> 01:07:59,814
Something woke the box
my people guard.

488
01:07:59,988 --> 01:08:02,034
It called out
to the dark place...

489
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:04,515
to one of Darkseid's
conquerors.

490
01:08:05,516 --> 01:08:07,735
The enemy is here.

491
01:08:07,909 --> 01:08:09,563
If he's here, where is he?

492
01:08:09,737 --> 01:08:11,826
He'll be searching
for the other two boxes.

493
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,960
Hiding until he has all three.
Until he's ready.

494
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:19,573
Then we have to be ready.
You, me, the others.

495
01:08:19,747 --> 01:08:22,533
They said the Age of Heroes
would never come again.

496
01:08:22,707 --> 01:08:24,100
No, it will.

497
01:08:24,274 --> 01:08:25,971
It has to.

498
01:08:27,755 --> 01:08:31,194
The others.
Where are they?

499
01:08:53,259 --> 01:08:54,304
Am I late?

500
01:08:54,478 --> 01:08:56,784
No, I'm so late.
I'm very late.

501
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:58,525
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey.

502
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:00,397
Oh. No.

503
01:09:00,571 --> 01:09:03,443
Okay, bye. Okay.

504
01:09:03,617 --> 01:09:05,750
I'm so sorry.

505
01:09:05,924 --> 01:09:07,143
I'm late.

506
01:09:12,713 --> 01:09:14,367
- Are you, uh...
- I'm...

507
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:16,345
I'm so sorry I'm so late.
I didn't mean to be so late.

508
01:09:16,369 --> 01:09:17,999
I'm me and I'm here
and I'm so sorry I'm late.

509
01:09:18,023 --> 01:09:19,218
Essentially,
the bus didn't come,

510
01:09:19,242 --> 01:09:20,417
then the bus did come,

511
01:09:20,591 --> 01:09:21,698
but then there was
this old woman

512
01:09:21,722 --> 01:09:22,941
counting change for the fare,

513
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:24,551
like, nickel, penny,
nickel, penny.

514
01:09:24,725 --> 01:09:26,007
Like, jeez Louise,
let this woman on the bus.

515
01:09:26,031 --> 01:09:27,554
She's 107 years old,

516
01:09:27,728 --> 01:09:28,966
these are some of her
last few moments of life.

517
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:30,296
Resume.

518
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:31,470
Resume.

519
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:36,650
Come on.

520
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,263
Come on.

521
01:09:40,437 --> 01:09:42,090
From the French, of course.

522
01:09:42,265 --> 01:09:45,137
"Resume," I believe,
is a past participle of...

523
01:09:50,621 --> 01:09:52,449
Uh, wow. That's no good.

524
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:54,263
It's like, what lives
in my pocket, right?

525
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,844
"Paper monster hungry."
Uh...

526
01:10:05,113 --> 01:10:07,681
Come on. Supposed to be
friends now.

527
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:15,298
Yes.

528
01:10:24,394 --> 01:10:26,787
Central City College,
I'm a criminal justice major.

529
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:28,112
You said you had experience

530

See, in times of crisis,
for dog work,

544
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:16,566
I always bring a meat snack.

'Cause you never know
what's going to happen in this city.

547
01:13:20,352 --> 01:13:21,919
I mean, oh, my gosh.

548
01:13:22,093 --> 01:13:24,574
Right? I start on Monday?

549
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,528
You have been
near a Mother Box.

550
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:09,227
The scent is on you.

551
01:14:09,401 --> 01:14:10,968
Where is it?

552
01:14:11,142 --> 01:14:14,537
No son or daughter of Atlantis
will ever tell you.

553
01:14:29,595 --> 01:14:31,162
Our people have guarded
the Mother Box

554
01:14:31,336 --> 01:14:32,380
for thousands of years.

555
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:41,172
I will never betray
my own people.

556
01:14:52,749 --> 01:14:55,186
You already have.

557
01:15:55,638 --> 01:15:58,249
This was taken in
the deepest trench on Earth.

558
01:15:58,423 --> 01:16:00,468
He must be an Atlantean.

559
01:16:00,643 --> 01:16:02,209
A water-breather.

560
01:16:02,383 --> 01:16:03,752
He was breathing air
when I talked to him.

561
01:16:03,776 --> 01:16:05,561
Mixed-blood, then.

562
01:16:05,735 --> 01:16:07,606
He said he'll fight with us?

563
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:09,086
More or less.

564
01:16:10,478 --> 01:16:12,829
More more or more less?

565
01:16:13,003 --> 01:16:14,004
Probably more less.

566
01:16:14,178 --> 01:16:16,267
- He said no?
- He said no.

567
01:16:16,441 --> 01:16:18,878
Atlanteans
can be tricky.

568
01:16:19,052 --> 01:16:21,707
My people went to war
with them once.

569
01:16:22,926 --> 01:16:24,884
I'm not sure we can trust him.

570
01:16:25,058 --> 01:16:26,218
Diana,
if we're gonna do this,

571
01:16:26,364 --> 01:16:27,484
you're gonna need to be open

572
01:16:27,626 --> 01:16:28,864
to more things
that we didn't...

573
01:16:28,888 --> 01:16:30,194
you know...

574
01:16:30,368 --> 01:16:31,780
- I'm sorry. That's okay.
- Sorry. My fault.

575
01:16:31,804 --> 01:16:33,042
Don't worry about it.

576
01:16:33,066 --> 01:16:34,328
- Let's...
- It happens.

577
01:16:34,502 --> 01:16:36,069
so...

578
01:16:36,243 --> 01:16:37,656
This is the
third person.

579
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,073
Disappears for 1/30
of a second here.

580
01:16:40,247 --> 01:16:41,727
One frame of video, see?

581
01:16:41,901 --> 01:16:44,425
Barry Allen. Central City.

582
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,600
Go to him.

583
01:16:45,688 --> 01:16:47,428
I'll work on number four.

584
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,649
Organic and biomechatronic
body parts.

585
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:55,219
He's a cyborg.

586
01:17:14,412 --> 01:17:16,327
- Ready!
- Break!

587
01:17:31,864 --> 01:17:33,083
Three...

588
01:17:33,257 --> 01:17:34,737
eighty...

589
01:17:35,868 --> 01:17:37,914
set... go!

590
01:17:51,275 --> 01:17:53,494
Your son may be captain
of the football team

591
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:56,628
and a certified genius,
Mrs. Stone...

592
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:58,804
Dr. Stone.

593
01:18:01,459 --> 01:18:03,499
...but that doesn't mean
he can hack into our system

594
01:18:03,635 --> 01:18:06,246
to change his friend's grades.

595
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:10,163
Sarah's family
lost their house this year.

596
01:18:10,337 --> 01:18:12,688
How could that child
pass her classes?

597
01:18:14,341 --> 01:18:17,388
Victor helped her
'cause he's got a good heart.

598
01:18:17,562 --> 01:18:19,520
What did you do to help her?

599
01:19:43,735 --> 01:19:46,607
- Your father...
- Mom, Mom, don't.

600
01:19:48,218 --> 01:19:50,960
He got held up at the lab.

601
01:19:51,134 --> 01:19:54,137
Okay. He always does.

602
01:19:56,748 --> 01:19:58,141
He wanted to be here.

603
01:19:58,315 --> 01:20:00,230
You always say that.

604
01:20:00,404 --> 01:20:02,145
Ma, you gotta stop
making excuses for him.

605
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:05,017
You're just as busy as he is,
but you still make the time.

606
01:20:05,191 --> 01:20:08,716
He just has difficulty
showing it, but...

607
01:20:08,891 --> 01:20:11,110
I know he's proud of you.

608
01:20:11,284 --> 01:20:13,721
We both are, Victor.

609
01:20:13,896 --> 01:20:17,116
Hey, hey, hey.

610
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:20,337
With everything I know
you can do today,

611
01:20:20,511 --> 01:20:23,166
I can't wait to see
what you're gonna be tomorrow.

612
01:20:28,606 --> 01:20:30,216
Dr. Stone,
I'm sorry,

613
01:20:31,391 --> 01:20:33,132
your wife didn't survive.

614
01:20:34,873 --> 01:20:36,875
I'm afraid
your son won't either.

615
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:52,717
I won't let you die.

616
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,243
I won't allow it.

617
01:21:03,597 --> 01:21:05,295
I won't allow it.

618
01:21:08,776 --> 01:21:09,777
Victor.

619
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:14,608
Victor, you're not
stuck in here.

620
01:21:14,782 --> 01:21:18,047
You still have a life
ahead of you.

621
01:21:18,221 --> 01:21:21,441
Your mother would have
wanted you to live that life.

622
01:21:24,096 --> 01:21:25,619
If you were there,

623
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:28,884
Mom would still be alive.

624
01:21:31,712 --> 01:21:33,540
All right, look,

625
01:21:35,064 --> 01:21:37,370
you don't have to give me
a second chance,

626
01:21:37,544 --> 01:21:39,024
but give yourself one.

627
01:21:41,157 --> 01:21:44,116
If you can't stand
looking at me,

628
01:21:45,857 --> 01:21:47,467
try listening.

629
01:22:16,279 --> 01:22:18,934
What you can do now, Victor.

630
01:22:19,108 --> 01:22:22,633
Your physical strength is
just the tip of the iceberg.

631
01:22:22,807 --> 01:22:25,288
The tip of the tip.

632
01:22:55,448 --> 01:22:57,450
In the world
of ones and zeroes,

633
01:22:57,624 --> 01:23:00,279
you are the absolute master.

634
01:23:00,453 --> 01:23:03,021
No firewall can stop you.

635
01:23:03,195 --> 01:23:05,502
No encryption can defy you.

636
01:23:05,676 --> 01:23:08,461
We're all at your mercy, Vic.

637
01:23:08,635 --> 01:23:10,986
From our power grids
to our telecommunications,

638
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,205
everyone's lives
are controlled

639
01:23:13,379 --> 01:23:16,339
and dominated
by complex digital networks

640
01:23:16,513 --> 01:23:20,517
that will bend
without effort to your will.

641
01:23:30,918 --> 01:23:32,442
The fate of the world

642
01:23:32,616 --> 01:23:35,358
will literally
rest in your hands.

643
01:23:43,192 --> 01:23:45,281
Its entire nuclear arsenal,

644
01:23:45,455 --> 01:23:48,197
you could launch
with a thought.

645
01:23:59,077 --> 01:24:00,470
The world's monetary systems

646
01:24:00,644 --> 01:24:02,254
and its complex interactions

647
01:24:02,428 --> 01:24:05,083
will seem as easy
to manipulate for you

648
01:24:05,257 --> 01:24:06,824
as a child's plaything.

649
01:24:40,901 --> 01:24:45,341
The question...
No, the challenge

650
01:24:45,515 --> 01:24:48,692
won't be doing it.

651
01:24:48,866 --> 01:24:50,694
It will be not doing.

652
01:24:50,868 --> 01:24:52,870
Not seeing.

653
01:24:54,959 --> 01:24:57,266
It is the burden
of this responsibility

654
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:00,660
that will define you
and who you choose to be.

655
01:25:32,301 --> 01:25:33,302
Now, make a wish.

656
01:25:34,651 --> 01:25:36,479
One more time.

657
01:25:36,653 --> 01:25:39,003
Good job. Wave to Grandma!

658
01:25:39,177 --> 01:25:40,309
Hi, Grandma!

659
01:26:40,586 --> 01:26:41,631
What?

660
01:26:43,763 --> 01:26:45,330
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

661
01:26:46,636 --> 01:26:47,985
Oh, my God.

662
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:49,856
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

663
01:26:55,253 --> 01:26:58,125
Victor...

664
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:02,652
Victor, these are the words
and deductions of a scientist.

665
01:27:02,826 --> 01:27:04,958
That's how I've been
speaking to you.

666
01:27:05,698 --> 01:27:08,962
Now,

667
01:27:09,136 --> 01:27:13,097
let me speak to you
from my heart, not as a scientist,

668
01:27:13,271 --> 01:27:14,446
as a father.

669
01:27:28,852 --> 01:27:29,940
Hey.

670
01:27:31,202 --> 01:27:32,943
Hey, you!

671
01:27:48,785 --> 01:27:52,092
Because you are
holding yourself back.

672
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:55,313
You're going in circles, man.

673
01:27:55,487 --> 01:27:57,620
Holding down
three dead-end jobs,

674
01:27:57,794 --> 01:27:58,969
going on four.

675
01:27:59,143 --> 01:28:00,405
Where do you
even find the time?

676
01:28:00,579 --> 01:28:01,798
I make the time.

677
01:28:01,972 --> 01:28:03,452
- I just need one more gig...
- Barry.

678
01:28:03,539 --> 01:28:04,365
...then I'm gonna pay
for my own tuition.

679
01:28:04,366 --> 01:28:05,498
You can't.

680
01:28:05,671 --> 01:28:06,996
Like I always said
I would.

681
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:08,544
You cannot keep
doing this to yourself.

682
01:28:08,718 --> 01:28:10,348
Okay. I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

683
01:28:10,372 --> 01:28:11,697
- Please, we have 10 minutes.
- And this is all to pay

684
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:12,785
for a criminal justice degree,
huh?

685
01:28:12,809 --> 01:28:13,809
Yeah.

686
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:15,290
For what?

687
01:28:15,464 --> 01:28:18,336
Huh, let's see.
As I talk to my father,

688
01:28:18,510 --> 01:28:19,990
who's still in prison
for the murder

689
01:28:20,164 --> 01:28:21,731
of my mother,
which he didn't commit.

690
01:28:21,905 --> 01:28:23,578
Yeah, how did I get interested
in criminal justice?

691
01:28:23,602 --> 01:28:25,125
I can't remember.

692
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,562
Oh, boy.

693
01:28:26,736 --> 01:28:28,912
This path has clearly
chosen me, Dad.

694
01:28:29,956 --> 01:28:31,001
Give me your hand, man.

695
01:28:36,702 --> 01:28:39,879
I want you
to listen to me, Barry.

696
01:28:40,053 --> 01:28:43,492
I want you to listen to me,
because I mean this.

697
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:51,326
I want you
to give all that up.

698
01:28:54,416 --> 01:28:57,332
And I want you to stop
coming to see me.

699
01:28:59,812 --> 01:29:02,772
I am a drag on your life.

700
01:29:08,212 --> 01:29:10,127
Okay. Um...

701
01:29:10,301 --> 01:29:13,652
Please don't ever
say that to me again.

702
01:29:13,826 --> 01:29:15,088
Please.

703
01:29:15,262 --> 01:29:16,622
Hey, you know what
criminal justice

704
01:29:16,786 --> 01:29:18,353
would be for me?

705
01:29:18,527 --> 01:29:23,270
My son not wasting his life.

706
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:26,404
You can be
whatever you wanna be.

707
01:29:26,578 --> 01:29:27,884
You're brilliant, man.

708
01:29:30,452 --> 01:29:33,237
Absolute best of the best.

709
01:29:35,195 --> 01:29:39,809
I can't sit here and watch you
run in place in Central City

710
01:29:39,983 --> 01:29:41,724
for some old dude

711
01:29:41,898 --> 01:29:45,075
who's not going anywhere.

712
01:29:45,249 --> 01:29:46,705
- Dad, that's not true.
- It's time.

713
01:29:46,729 --> 01:29:47,991
That's not true.

714
01:29:48,165 --> 01:29:49,577
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

715
01:29:49,601 --> 01:29:51,255
I want you
to make your own future.

716
01:29:51,429 --> 01:29:53,233
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

717
01:29:53,257 --> 01:29:54,650
Open gate.

718
01:29:54,824 --> 01:29:56,086
Great.

719
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:02,329
"You're living in the past.
Make your own future, Barry."

720
01:30:02,353 --> 01:30:03,793
Clear.
Close the gate.

721
01:30:56,538 --> 01:30:59,889
Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.

722
01:31:00,063 --> 01:31:01,673
You said that like it explains

723
01:31:01,847 --> 01:31:04,023
why there's a total stranger
in my place

724
01:31:04,197 --> 01:31:06,983
sitting in the dark,
in my second favorite chair.

725
01:31:09,072 --> 01:31:10,813
Tell me about this.

726
01:31:14,991 --> 01:31:17,689
This is a person
who looks exactly like me,

727
01:31:17,863 --> 01:31:20,518
but who is definitely not me.

728
01:31:21,693 --> 01:31:23,565
Somebody... I don't know.

729
01:31:23,739 --> 01:31:25,567
Hippie, long hair.

730
01:31:25,741 --> 01:31:28,483
Very attractive Jewish boy.

731
01:31:30,049 --> 01:31:32,617
Who drinks milk,
I don't drink milk.

732
01:31:32,791 --> 01:31:34,358
I know you have abilities.

733
01:31:34,532 --> 01:31:36,578
I just don't know
what they are.

734
01:31:36,752 --> 01:31:37,753
My special skills

735
01:31:37,927 --> 01:31:40,712
include viola, web design,

736
01:31:40,886 --> 01:31:43,672
fluent in sign language,
gorilla sign language.

737
01:31:43,846 --> 01:31:47,414
Silica-based
sand quartz fabric.

738
01:31:47,589 --> 01:31:49,678
Abrasion resistant,
heat resistant.

739
01:31:49,852 --> 01:31:51,723
Uh, yeah, I do
competitive ice dancing.

740
01:31:51,897 --> 01:31:53,682
It's what they use
on the space shuttle

741
01:31:53,856 --> 01:31:55,496
to prevent it from
burning up on re-entry.

742
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:58,034
I do very competitive
ice dancing.

743
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,428
Look, man.
I don't know who you are,

744
01:32:01,603 --> 01:32:03,561
but whoever
you're looking for,

745
01:32:03,735 --> 01:32:04,735
it's not me.

746
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,388
You're the Batman?

747
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:51,478
So, you're fast.

748
01:32:51,653 --> 01:32:53,176
That feels
like an oversimplification.

749
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:55,091
I'm putting together a team.

750
01:32:55,265 --> 01:32:57,354
People with special abilities.

751
01:32:57,528 --> 01:32:59,008
You see,
I believe enemies are coming.

752
01:32:59,182 --> 01:33:01,184
Stop right there. I'm in.

753
01:33:02,272 --> 01:33:03,578
You are?

754
01:33:03,752 --> 01:33:04,796
Just like that?

755
01:33:04,970 --> 01:33:06,058
Yeah.

756
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:10,454
I need friends.

757
01:33:10,628 --> 01:33:13,979
Great. Great.

758
01:33:14,153 --> 01:33:16,373
Can I keep this?

759
01:33:16,547 --> 01:33:18,288
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

760
01:33:18,462 --> 01:33:20,116
and it seems
to manipulate space-time.

761
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:21,813
I call it the Speed Force.

762
01:33:21,987 --> 01:33:23,661
Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories

763
01:33:23,685 --> 01:33:26,252
so I am just a black hole
of snacks.

764
01:33:26,426 --> 01:33:29,038
I am a snack hole.

765
01:33:29,212 --> 01:33:31,997
How many people are
on this special fight team?

766
01:33:32,171 --> 01:33:34,086
- Three, including you.
- Three?

767
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:36,828
Against what?

768
01:33:37,002 --> 01:33:38,438
I'll tell you on the plane.

769
01:33:39,091 --> 01:33:40,789
Plane?

770
01:33:40,963 --> 01:33:42,704
What are your
superpowers again?

771
01:33:42,878 --> 01:33:44,575
I'm rich.

772
01:34:07,685 --> 01:34:09,513
Oh, Miss Prince,
let me do that.

773
01:34:09,687 --> 01:34:12,647
No, that's okay.
I can do it myself.

774
01:34:12,821 --> 01:34:14,300
Would you like
to have some?

775
01:34:14,474 --> 01:34:15,737
Uh, no, thank you.

776
01:34:17,173 --> 01:34:19,741
If you put the water in first.

777
01:34:19,915 --> 01:34:22,831
- Of course.
- So we don't scald the tea.

778
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:27,357
- Yes.
- Great.

779
01:34:27,531 --> 01:34:29,446
No, that's probably
enough tea.

780
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:31,970
All right.

781
01:34:32,144 --> 01:34:33,668
Are you sure you don't
wanna have some?

782
01:34:33,842 --> 01:34:37,628
I won't, thank you.
And then leave it to mash.

783
01:34:37,802 --> 01:34:40,718
I will.
I will, definitely will.

784
01:34:40,892 --> 01:34:43,112
Uh... What are you working on?

785
01:34:43,286 --> 01:34:45,027
It's a gauntlet

786
01:34:45,201 --> 01:34:48,944
lined with specialized
polymer solar cells.

787
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:51,555
- Wow.
- Here, let me show you.

788
01:34:51,729 --> 01:34:54,601
We borrowed this from
the Kryptonian scout ship.

789
01:34:56,299 --> 01:34:57,779
Oh, maybe you should, uh...

790
01:34:57,953 --> 01:34:59,233
a fraction.
Thank you, thank you.

791
01:34:59,302 --> 01:35:00,346
Of course.

792
01:35:05,525 --> 01:35:07,266
Ah.

793
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,400
Ah, now,
let's see how that did.

794
01:35:10,574 --> 01:35:12,794
Ha! Yes.

795
01:35:12,968 --> 01:35:14,621
Not to be sneezed at.

796
01:35:14,796 --> 01:35:17,189
A gauntlet that captures
and dissipates energy.

797
01:35:17,363 --> 01:35:18,974
It's Master Wayne's idea.

798
01:35:19,148 --> 01:35:21,411
Maybe you should work
on a lasso, too?

799
01:35:21,585 --> 01:35:24,153
- In black, of course.
- Oh.

800
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:34,076
All right. Victor Stone.

801
01:35:50,396 --> 01:35:52,659
Something is not working.

802
01:35:52,834 --> 01:35:54,444
Mmm.

803
01:36:04,236 --> 01:36:06,543
Looks like you have a date,
Miss Prince.

804
01:37:03,687 --> 01:37:06,733
Why are you looking
for me, Diana?

805
01:37:06,908 --> 01:37:08,300
You know who I am.

806
01:37:08,474 --> 01:37:10,694
I know more than you
can possibly imagine.

807
01:37:10,868 --> 01:37:13,915
Then maybe you already know
I need your help.

808
01:37:14,089 --> 01:37:15,089
The world does.

809
01:37:16,482 --> 01:37:18,093
Fuck the world.

810
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:22,097
You've obviously
been through a great deal.

811
01:37:23,446 --> 01:37:26,492
I can't begin to imagine what.

812
01:37:26,666 --> 01:37:30,105
But whatever happened to you,
you have gifts now.

813
01:37:30,279 --> 01:37:32,020
Gifts?

814
01:37:32,194 --> 01:37:34,326
What part of this
looks like a gift to you?

815
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,154
We need you, Victor.

816
01:37:36,328 --> 01:37:37,895
And maybe you need us.

817
01:37:38,069 --> 01:37:39,723
I don't need anyone.

818
01:37:41,943 --> 01:37:43,161
Not anymore.

819
01:37:43,335 --> 01:37:45,642
I told myself the same
for a long time.

820
01:37:52,518 --> 01:37:55,173
I lost someone I loved once.

821
01:37:58,089 --> 01:38:02,833
I shut myself off
from everyone.

822
01:38:04,530 --> 01:38:07,185
But I had to learn
to open back up again.

823
01:38:09,971 --> 01:38:13,365
The truth is,
I'm still working on it.

824
01:38:13,539 --> 01:38:17,456
And if you asked to meet me...

825
01:38:17,630 --> 01:38:20,285
you're working on it, too.

826
01:39:32,096 --> 01:39:33,968
You were right
about the metal sample

827
01:39:34,142 --> 01:39:35,752
from the Superman ship.

828
01:39:35,926 --> 01:39:39,277
When we bombard it with X-rays
from the electron-laser,

829
01:39:39,451 --> 01:39:40,887
look what happens.

830
01:39:49,896 --> 01:39:51,855
3.5 million kelvin.

831
01:39:52,029 --> 01:39:54,945
The inner core of the metal
becomes superheated.

832
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:57,426
Hot, dense matter.

833
01:40:00,777 --> 01:40:03,562
You're looking at
the hottest thing on Earth.

834
01:40:03,736 --> 01:40:05,825
Exact words I said
to my prom date.

835
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,479
She dumped me anyway.

836
01:40:07,653 --> 01:40:08,872
Yeah.

837
01:40:13,094 --> 01:40:14,269
Hey, Doc,

838
01:40:14,443 --> 01:40:16,097
do you think
Batman is connected

839
01:40:16,271 --> 01:40:18,664
to the object
the CID is looking for?

840
01:40:19,796 --> 01:40:22,886
You know, 6-1-9-8-2?

841
01:40:24,061 --> 01:40:25,106
No...

842
01:40:26,150 --> 01:40:27,325
I don't.

843
01:41:02,186 --> 01:41:04,232
Oh, Victor.

844
01:41:21,423 --> 01:41:23,294
All right! Let's go!

845
01:41:24,687 --> 01:41:25,925
Commissioner Gordon?

846
01:41:25,949 --> 01:41:27,037
Come on!

847
01:41:27,211 --> 01:41:28,386
Your messages.

848
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:29,822
Hey, hey!

849
01:41:32,869 --> 01:41:35,480
Don't have to see the sky
to know it's a full moon.

850
01:41:35,654 --> 01:41:38,440
Half of Gotham's reality-challenged
community showed up.

851
01:41:38,614 --> 01:41:40,790
Say they saw flying monsters
by the harbor.

852
01:41:40,964 --> 01:41:42,922
You were right, Ma.
Police Academy.

853
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:44,663
What's wrong
with dental school?

854
01:41:47,797 --> 01:41:50,930
"Attacked by
a flying vampire."

855
01:41:51,105 --> 01:41:54,020
"Looked like a giant bat
with huge fangs."

856
01:41:54,195 --> 01:41:56,022
On a possibly related note,

857
01:41:56,197 --> 01:41:58,416
sketch of the suspect
in the abductions

858
01:41:58,590 --> 01:42:00,244
at the lab across the harbor.

859
01:42:00,418 --> 01:42:03,552
- Looks like...
- I know what it looks like, Crispus.

860
01:42:03,726 --> 01:42:06,163
Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here

861
01:42:06,337 --> 01:42:08,948
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

862
01:42:10,036 --> 01:42:11,081
I'll talk to him tonight.

863
01:42:11,255 --> 01:42:12,778
How, Jim?

864
01:42:12,952 --> 01:42:14,389
How do you think?

865
01:42:32,711 --> 01:42:34,017
Silas?

866
01:42:34,191 --> 01:42:35,366
Hey, hey.

867
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:36,846
Hey, hey!

868
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:43,920
- Oh, my goodness.
- Where's the cyborg?

869
01:42:44,027 --> 01:42:45,115
His name is Victor.

870
01:42:45,942 --> 01:42:48,684
We met, spoke.

871
01:42:49,685 --> 01:42:51,730
Give him time.

872
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:53,863
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

873
01:42:54,037 --> 01:42:57,780
Hi, Barry. I'm Diana.
That's not right. Great.

874
01:42:57,954 --> 01:43:00,043
- So, this is us.
- Yeah, this is us.

875
01:43:00,217 --> 01:43:01,610
Oh!

876
01:43:01,784 --> 01:43:04,439
Awesome! It's the Bat-Signal.
That's your...

877
01:43:04,613 --> 01:43:06,702
- Oh, sorry.
- That's your signal.

878
01:43:06,876 --> 01:43:08,573
That means we have to go now.

879
01:43:08,747 --> 01:43:12,011
- Yeah, that's what that means.
- It's so cool.

880
01:44:09,373 --> 01:44:11,070
Commander Mera,
I told the king

881
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:12,898
the perimeter guards
were taken.

882
01:44:13,072 --> 01:44:14,770
He won't send reinforcements.

883
01:44:14,944 --> 01:44:17,425
He says all the reserves are
needed in the rebel regions.

884
01:44:17,599 --> 01:44:21,820
He's as shortsighted
as he is cruel.

885
01:44:21,994 --> 01:44:23,561
All right, take what men
we have left

886
01:44:23,735 --> 01:44:25,389
and form a phalanx
around the Mother Box.

887
01:46:05,315 --> 01:46:07,317
You can't escape.

888
01:46:08,144 --> 01:46:10,059
I'm not trying to.

889
01:48:12,703 --> 01:48:14,879
Vulko told me
you would come.

890
01:48:15,053 --> 01:48:17,665
The firstborn
of beloved Queen Atlanna.

891
01:48:20,363 --> 01:48:21,582
Wait.

892
01:48:23,671 --> 01:48:24,672
Please.

893
01:48:28,327 --> 01:48:29,633
I knew her.

894
01:48:31,983 --> 01:48:34,290
Well, that makes one of us.

895
01:48:34,464 --> 01:48:35,987
My parents died in the wars.

896
01:48:37,946 --> 01:48:39,338
She took me in.

897
01:48:39,513 --> 01:48:41,340
What a saint.

898
01:48:41,515 --> 01:48:43,647
You dare speak
of Queen Atlanna that way?

899
01:48:43,821 --> 01:48:46,432
Your queen left me
on my father's doorstep

900
01:48:46,607 --> 01:48:48,173
and never gave me
another thought.

901
01:48:48,347 --> 01:48:51,525
Your mother left you
to save your life.

902
01:48:51,699 --> 01:48:54,092
You cannot imagine
how it hurt her.

903
01:48:55,703 --> 01:48:57,661
What it cost her.

904
01:48:59,010 --> 01:49:01,143
But you're not
a defenseless child now.

905
01:49:03,624 --> 01:49:05,190
It would have been
her responsibility

906
01:49:05,364 --> 01:49:08,454
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop him.

907
01:49:09,064 --> 01:49:10,152
Now,

908
01:49:11,457 --> 01:49:12,763
it's yours.

909
01:50:17,132 --> 01:50:18,568
Yes.

910
01:50:41,591 --> 01:50:42,940
Steppenwolf,

911
01:50:43,114 --> 01:50:45,029
tell me what you've learned.

912
01:50:45,203 --> 01:50:47,858
Two boxes
found and awake.

913
01:50:48,032 --> 01:50:50,992
With the combined power
of the two Mother Boxes,

914
01:50:51,166 --> 01:50:54,125
I've been able to finish
the stronghold's defenses.

915
01:50:54,299 --> 01:50:56,737
Where is the third Mother Box?

916
01:50:56,911 --> 01:50:59,304
The parademons
sense its presence

917
01:50:59,478 --> 01:51:01,002
and search for the third.

918
01:51:01,176 --> 01:51:02,177
They have taken prisoners

919
01:51:02,351 --> 01:51:04,396
who carry its scent.

920
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:06,877
Go.

921
01:51:07,051 --> 01:51:08,923
Interrogate the prisoners.

922
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:11,621
Find the third.

923
01:51:13,188 --> 01:51:15,320
They will tell me
what they know,

924
01:51:16,626 --> 01:51:19,063
or I will rip it from them.

925
01:52:02,454 --> 01:52:03,934
How many of you are there?

926
01:52:04,848 --> 01:52:05,936
Not enough.

927
01:52:08,112 --> 01:52:10,332
Dozens of witnesses
all over Gotham.

928
01:52:10,506 --> 01:52:11,706
Description
matches the suspect

929
01:52:11,855 --> 01:52:13,596
in the Metropolis abductions.

930
01:52:13,770 --> 01:52:14,770
Parademons.

931
01:52:15,424 --> 01:52:17,121
Okay.

932
01:52:17,295 --> 01:52:19,415
The demons must have caught
the scent of a Mother Box.

933
01:52:19,471 --> 01:52:21,082
At the lab.

934
01:52:21,256 --> 01:52:23,103
They carried people away
to find out what they know.

935
01:52:23,127 --> 01:52:24,322
So the eight
may still be alive.

936
01:52:24,346 --> 01:52:25,346
Nine.

937
01:52:25,434 --> 01:52:27,218
Oh.

938
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:29,830
The head of STARLABS
was taken tonight.

939
01:52:35,096 --> 01:52:37,620
Wow, okay.
So, another scientist.

940
01:52:37,794 --> 01:52:39,100
So, how do we find him?

941
01:52:39,274 --> 01:52:40,971
There must be a nest nearby.

942
01:52:41,145 --> 01:52:45,193
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

943
01:52:45,367 --> 01:52:47,499
No discernable pattern
I can see.

944
01:52:47,673 --> 01:52:49,073
The lines on the map
don't converge.

945
01:52:49,110 --> 01:52:50,502
On land.

946
01:52:50,676 --> 01:52:52,076
These lead back
to Stryker's Island,

947
01:52:52,113 --> 01:52:53,201
between the two cities.

948
01:52:53,375 --> 01:52:54,550
These are air vents.

949
01:52:54,724 --> 01:52:56,204
They all lead
down to the tunnel

950
01:52:56,378 --> 01:52:58,338
to a Metropolis project
that was abandoned in '29.

951
01:52:58,510 --> 01:53:00,730
The nest could be there.

952
01:53:00,904 --> 01:53:02,819
Uh,
is he coming with us now,

953
01:53:02,993 --> 01:53:04,713
because we're not all
gonna fit in your car.

954
01:53:04,821 --> 01:53:06,170
I have something bigger.

955
01:53:07,606 --> 01:53:10,392
Do you really think that...

956
01:53:10,566 --> 01:53:14,004
Oh, wow, they just...
They really just vanish, huh?

957
01:53:14,178 --> 01:53:16,615
Oh. That's rude.

958
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:57,439
We're close.

959
01:53:57,613 --> 01:53:59,571
The scent of the enemy.

960
01:54:00,355 --> 01:54:01,399
Of absence.

961
01:54:02,052 --> 01:54:03,532
Darkness.

962
01:54:04,315 --> 01:54:05,577
Death.

963
01:54:05,751 --> 01:54:07,144
Where are we, Alfred?

964
01:54:07,318 --> 01:54:08,339
Stryker's Island.

965
01:54:08,363 --> 01:54:10,321
You should be directly under

966
01:54:10,495 --> 01:54:13,107
the venting tower
for the tunnel.

967
01:54:13,281 --> 01:54:14,760
Now look to your left,

968
01:54:14,935 --> 01:54:16,762
you'll see a staircase
to the machine room.

969
01:54:16,937 --> 01:54:19,374
Thermal scan shows
a cluster of people there.

970
01:54:19,548 --> 01:54:20,723
That's it.

971
01:54:20,897 --> 01:54:22,290
Let's go.

972
01:54:36,391 --> 01:54:38,784
Right.
Is there... Is there a plan?

973
01:54:40,395 --> 01:54:41,700
Either of you?

974
01:54:41,875 --> 01:54:43,195
Don't engage alone.

975
01:54:43,789 --> 01:54:44,965
We do this together.

976
01:54:54,017 --> 01:54:55,845
I heard about you.

977
01:54:57,673 --> 01:54:59,109
Didn't think you were real.

978
01:54:59,283 --> 01:55:00,763
I'm real when it's useful.

979
01:55:11,121 --> 01:55:12,862
I grow tired of your silence.

980
01:55:13,036 --> 01:55:15,125
Now tell me,
where is the Mother Box?

981
01:55:22,002 --> 01:55:24,221
Please. We have families.

982
01:55:24,395 --> 01:55:26,441
Then you have weakness.

983
01:55:26,615 --> 01:55:28,138
Steppenwolf.

984
01:55:28,312 --> 01:55:32,447
Okay, I'm guessing
that's the bad guy.

985
01:55:32,621 --> 01:55:34,101
Good guess.

986
01:55:34,275 --> 01:55:37,669
I'm really, really missing
Superman right now.

987
01:55:37,843 --> 01:55:40,020
Circle to the other side.

988
01:55:40,194 --> 01:55:42,109
We'll surround them
and surprise him.

989
01:55:46,722 --> 01:55:48,593
You have been
near a Mother Box.

990
01:55:48,767 --> 01:55:50,465
The scent is on you.

991
01:55:50,639 --> 01:55:52,159
I don't know
what you're talking about.

992
01:55:52,293 --> 01:55:54,077
- Where is it?
- Leave him alone!

993
01:55:54,251 --> 01:55:56,427
He... He doesn't know.

994
01:56:00,083 --> 01:56:01,780
Wait, please, please!

995
01:56:07,612 --> 01:56:10,398
You carry
the scent, too. But stronger.

996
01:56:10,572 --> 01:56:12,661
I will die before I tell you.

997
01:56:12,835 --> 01:56:14,924
You'll die if you don't.

998
01:56:15,098 --> 01:56:16,098
No!

999
01:56:25,456 --> 01:56:26,501
Victor.

1000
01:56:26,675 --> 01:56:27,850
Kill them both.

1001
01:56:31,506 --> 01:56:33,812
Ah, Amazon.

1002
01:56:33,987 --> 01:56:36,467
But not like your sisters.

1003
01:56:36,641 --> 01:56:37,860
Stronger.

1004
01:57:08,847 --> 01:57:11,024
Amazon.

1005
01:57:13,548 --> 01:57:15,115
Hold!

1006
01:57:15,289 --> 01:57:17,421
This one will be mine.

1007
01:57:19,467 --> 01:57:21,860
I belong to no one.

1008
01:57:35,918 --> 01:57:37,876
Guys, this is not together.

1009
01:57:44,970 --> 01:57:46,494
Help get those people
out of here.

1010
01:57:46,668 --> 01:57:48,508
I'll make sure these things
follow me.

1011
01:57:58,375 --> 01:57:59,768
Everybody, move!

1012
01:58:08,559 --> 01:58:10,039
A little quicker.

1013
01:58:12,433 --> 01:58:13,825
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

1014
01:58:13,999 --> 01:58:16,350
I've got this. Keep moving.

1015
01:58:18,395 --> 01:58:19,395
This way.

1016
01:58:55,780 --> 01:58:57,173
The energy
is dissipating.

1017
01:58:57,347 --> 01:58:59,958
My gauntlet worked!

1018
01:59:00,133 --> 01:59:02,396
Celebrate later, Alfred.
I need the Nightcrawler.

1019
01:59:02,570 --> 01:59:04,615
Thought you'd never ask.

1020
01:59:04,789 --> 01:59:06,878
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

1021
01:59:37,039 --> 01:59:38,040
Thank you, Alfred.

1022
01:59:38,214 --> 01:59:39,520
Don't mention it.

1023
02:00:02,325 --> 02:00:03,325
No!

1024
02:00:06,982 --> 02:00:07,983
Whew.

1025
02:00:11,378 --> 02:00:12,818
They're safe.
Get back to the tunnel.

1026
02:00:12,988 --> 02:00:16,121
Tunnel. Right.
Aliens, bad guy, sword lady.

1027
02:00:27,829 --> 02:00:29,178
My turn.

1028
02:01:51,652 --> 02:01:53,282
Catastrophic failure
of all systems.

1029
02:01:53,306 --> 02:01:55,699
Are you all right,
Master Wayne?

1030
02:01:55,873 --> 02:01:56,873
Are you all right?

1031
02:02:07,624 --> 02:02:11,019
You have the blood
of the old gods in you.

1032
02:02:25,381 --> 02:02:26,381
You okay?

1033
02:02:26,948 --> 02:02:28,210
Mm.

1034
02:02:28,384 --> 02:02:29,994
Wasn't sure you'd come.

1035
02:02:31,082 --> 02:02:32,345
You're my father.

1036
02:02:35,870 --> 02:02:36,870
Go.

1037
02:02:50,493 --> 02:02:51,493
No!

1038
02:03:37,018 --> 02:03:39,324
Relax, Alfred.
I'll take it from here.

1039
02:03:40,935 --> 02:03:42,676
Uh, do I know you?

1040
02:04:13,663 --> 02:04:14,838
What are we under, right now?

1041
02:04:15,665 --> 02:04:16,884
Gotham Harbor.

1042
02:04:55,662 --> 02:04:56,880
Who is that?

1043
02:05:22,297 --> 02:05:23,428
Come on.

1044
02:05:28,564 --> 02:05:29,696
Diana, get on!

1045
02:06:31,671 --> 02:06:33,150
What is it?

1046
02:06:40,984 --> 02:06:42,377
Show me.

1047
02:07:21,546 --> 02:07:23,157
It is here.

1048
02:07:23,984 --> 02:07:26,856
On this world.

1049
02:08:00,847 --> 02:08:02,196
Sir, you're gonna
be in quarantine

1050
02:08:02,370 --> 02:08:03,806
for possible alien microbes.

1051
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:05,634
U.S. government protocols
require that...

1052
02:08:05,808 --> 02:08:08,550
I know the requirements.
I wrote them.

1053
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:14,425
It called to him.

1054
02:08:14,599 --> 02:08:16,166
The Mother Box.

1055
02:08:16,340 --> 02:08:17,907
The one he already has.

1056
02:08:18,081 --> 02:08:21,084
He has two. He took
the Mother Box from Atlantis.

1057
02:08:21,258 --> 02:08:23,565
All he needs now
is the lost Box of Men.

1058
02:08:23,739 --> 02:08:24,939
If he doesn't already have it.

1059
02:08:28,570 --> 02:08:29,919
He doesn't have it.

1060
02:08:33,183 --> 02:08:34,315
I do.

1061
02:08:44,934 --> 02:08:46,980
Have you finished
the conquest?

1062
02:08:47,154 --> 02:08:48,416
Not yet, DeSaad.

1063
02:08:48,590 --> 02:08:50,810
Then why do you summon me?

1064
02:08:50,984 --> 02:08:52,681
I bring news.

1065
02:08:52,855 --> 02:08:55,771
Before mighty Darkseid
came to the throne,

1066
02:08:55,945 --> 02:09:00,863
he searched the universe
for the ultimate weapon.

1067
02:09:01,037 --> 02:09:03,213
The Anti-Life Equation.

1068
02:09:03,387 --> 02:09:05,389
The key to
controlling all life

1069
02:09:05,563 --> 02:09:08,088
and all will
throughout the multiverse.

1070
02:09:08,262 --> 02:09:11,221
He found it hidden on a primitive planet,
but before...

1071
02:09:11,395 --> 02:09:14,268
The story of the defiance
is well-known.

1072
02:09:14,442 --> 02:09:16,923
I have found
the primitive planet.

1073
02:09:17,097 --> 02:09:19,142
The world that fought back.

1074
02:09:19,316 --> 02:09:21,188
It is Earth.

1075
02:09:21,362 --> 02:09:23,581
The Anti-Life Equation
is carved

1076
02:09:23,756 --> 02:09:27,498
into the surface
of this very world.

1077
02:09:31,285 --> 02:09:32,677
Are you certain?

1078
02:09:32,852 --> 02:09:34,027
I have seen it.

1079
02:09:34,201 --> 02:09:37,378
I have looked
with my own eyes.

1080
02:09:39,336 --> 02:09:40,336
Anti-Life.

1081
02:10:20,813 --> 02:10:22,379
My lord.

1082
02:10:23,946 --> 02:10:28,037
Oh, Steppenwolf.

1083
02:10:28,211 --> 02:10:32,085
My lord, I am
but your humble servant.

1084
02:10:32,259 --> 02:10:35,088
Can it be true
that you have found it?

1085
02:10:35,262 --> 02:10:38,004
I have, great one.

1086
02:10:38,178 --> 02:10:41,137
The lost world is Earth.

1087
02:10:41,311 --> 02:10:45,489
Anti-Life is here.

1088
02:10:45,663 --> 02:10:49,015
If it is redemption you seek,
find the third box,

1089
02:10:49,189 --> 02:10:52,105
synchronize The Unity,
and when this world is scorched,

1090
02:10:52,279 --> 02:10:55,456
I will come
for my great prize.

1091
02:10:56,457 --> 02:10:59,547
You will come to Earth?

1092
02:10:59,721 --> 02:11:03,943
I have turned
100,000 worlds to dust

1093
02:11:04,117 --> 02:11:05,640
looking for Anti-Life.

1094
02:11:05,814 --> 02:11:08,991
Looking for those
who robbed me of my glory.

1095
02:11:09,165 --> 02:11:12,342
I will stride
across their bones

1096
02:11:12,516 --> 02:11:14,910
and bask in the glow
of Anti-Life.

1097
02:11:15,084 --> 02:11:17,782
And all of existence

1098
02:11:17,957 --> 02:11:21,351
shall be mine.

1099
02:11:24,877 --> 02:11:28,750
It shall be so, my master.

1100
02:11:32,972 --> 02:11:34,843
So cool.

1101
02:11:35,017 --> 02:11:37,628
From the outside, it looks like
this building was abandoned.

1102
02:11:41,110 --> 02:11:42,851
It wants to fly.

1103
02:11:44,070 --> 02:11:46,072
You talk to machines?

1104
02:11:46,246 --> 02:11:48,248
I speak
to intelligence.

1105
02:11:48,422 --> 02:11:49,622
This one's saying
she can't fly

1106
02:11:49,771 --> 02:11:51,294
because of a software issue,

1107
02:11:51,468 --> 02:11:53,340
but I could fix it
with a little time.

1108
02:12:03,219 --> 02:12:05,569
There's a dark spot
in my data stream.

1109
02:12:05,743 --> 02:12:07,963
I could feel
the other two boxes.

1110
02:12:08,137 --> 02:12:09,965
I know they're awake,

1111
02:12:10,139 --> 02:12:11,793
but I can't see
where they are.

1112
02:12:11,967 --> 02:12:13,945
Well, we can't attack unless
we know where the base is.

1113
02:12:13,969 --> 02:12:16,276
Even if we knew,

1114
02:12:16,450 --> 02:12:19,192
I've never seen a being
as strong as Steppenwolf.

1115
02:12:21,455 --> 02:12:22,673
Maybe one.

1116
02:12:22,847 --> 02:12:25,328
Hmm, Superman.

1117
02:12:25,502 --> 02:12:27,219
As long as
the third box is asleep,

1118
02:12:27,243 --> 02:12:29,550
they can't see it,
only sense it.

1119
02:12:29,724 --> 02:12:31,769
We need to keep moving
so they can't catch up.

1120
02:12:31,944 --> 02:12:33,467
No. That's just a strategy

1121
02:12:33,641 --> 02:12:35,556
to lose more slowly,
not to win.

1122
02:12:35,730 --> 02:12:38,428
Remind me, are flamethrowers
not a thing?

1123
02:12:38,602 --> 02:12:39,762
Why don't we just destroy it?

1124
02:12:39,908 --> 02:12:41,954
Fire doesn't
destroy the boxes.

1125
02:12:42,128 --> 02:12:43,694
They're an unknown form
of matter.

1126
02:12:43,868 --> 02:12:45,174
Oh, they love heat.

1127
02:12:45,348 --> 02:12:47,481
They absorb it,
hold it in their cores.

1128
02:12:47,655 --> 02:12:50,179
Well, you know
a lot about these boxes.

1129
02:12:50,353 --> 02:12:51,615
Makes you think.

1130
02:12:51,789 --> 02:12:54,270
Where'd you find the box,
Victor?

1131
02:12:54,444 --> 02:12:55,968
Are you trying
to say something?

1132
02:12:56,142 --> 02:12:58,100
Oh, I'm saying it.

1133
02:12:58,274 --> 02:13:00,015
How do we know you're not
working for them?

1134
02:13:01,974 --> 02:13:03,932
It's a long story.

1135
02:13:04,106 --> 02:13:05,978
You got somewhere else to be?

1136
02:13:13,420 --> 02:13:14,987
The Nazis found the box

1137
02:13:15,161 --> 02:13:17,250
at the end
of the Second World War,

1138
02:13:17,424 --> 02:13:20,470
buried under
an Italian monastery.

1139
02:13:20,644 --> 02:13:23,038
The Allies intercepted it
on its way to Hitler.

1140
02:13:23,212 --> 02:13:25,823
They brought it back
to the States in '44.

1141
02:13:25,998 --> 02:13:30,263
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.

1142
02:13:30,437 --> 02:13:32,178
It collected dust
in the Pentagon archives

1143
02:13:32,352 --> 02:13:34,267
for 70 years

1144
02:13:34,441 --> 02:13:37,574
till DoD began to study
the Superman ship.

1145
02:13:39,185 --> 02:13:41,491
A researcher at STARLABS
made a connection

1146
02:13:41,665 --> 02:13:42,665
between the ship...

1147
02:13:43,928 --> 02:13:46,235
and 6-1-9-8-2.

1148
02:13:46,409 --> 02:13:49,717
He understood they were
both alien technologies.

1149
02:13:49,891 --> 02:13:51,849
Different civilizations,

1150
02:13:52,024 --> 02:13:55,375
similar properties.

1151
02:13:55,549 --> 02:13:58,769
And though the box had slept
for thousands of years,

1152
02:13:58,943 --> 02:14:02,208
the researcher formulated
a theory on how to awaken it.

1153
02:14:02,382 --> 02:14:04,079
And so did.

1154
02:14:06,429 --> 02:14:07,429
Then...

1155
02:14:09,606 --> 02:14:12,653
I had an accident
that should've killed me.

1156
02:14:12,827 --> 02:14:16,048
But in an act of desperation
or madness,

1157
02:14:16,222 --> 02:14:18,441
the researcher harnessed
the power of the Mother Box.

1158
02:14:34,718 --> 02:14:36,807
He unleashed
an alien technology

1159
02:14:36,981 --> 02:14:39,636
he didn't fully understand.

1160
02:14:39,810 --> 02:14:42,117
He used that power
to keep me alive.

1161
02:14:45,729 --> 02:14:47,731
Alive...

1162
02:14:47,905 --> 02:14:49,820
but turned into this.

1163
02:14:52,649 --> 02:14:54,869
The box went back to sleep

1164
02:14:55,870 --> 02:14:57,480
and he never returned it.

1165
02:15:00,179 --> 02:15:02,137
That researcher
was Silas Stone.

1166
02:15:03,878 --> 02:15:05,488
My father.

1167
02:15:08,839 --> 02:15:10,580
Wait,

1168
02:15:10,754 --> 02:15:14,106
your father saved your life
with one of these things?

1169
02:15:14,280 --> 02:15:16,456
Aren't they
psycho murder machines?

1170
02:15:16,630 --> 02:15:19,023
They're change machines.

1171
02:15:19,198 --> 02:15:22,070
The boxes don't think in terms
of healing or killing,

1172
02:15:22,244 --> 02:15:24,377
alive or dead.

1173
02:15:24,551 --> 02:15:26,770
They rearrange matter
at the will of their masters,

1174
02:15:26,944 --> 02:15:28,511
regenerate, reinstate.

1175
02:15:28,685 --> 02:15:29,991
Reinstate?

1176
02:15:30,165 --> 02:15:31,601
A box has the power

1177
02:15:31,775 --> 02:15:33,690
to reinstate anterior
particle relationships.

1178
02:15:33,864 --> 02:15:35,744
So, you mean in the way
that particles of matter

1179
02:15:35,823 --> 02:15:37,023
can't be created or destroyed,

1180
02:15:37,129 --> 02:15:39,131
their relations
just transform.

1181
02:15:39,305 --> 02:15:42,046
Burn down a house,
the particles still exist.

1182
02:15:42,221 --> 02:15:44,658
Particles of house
become particles of smoke.

1183
02:15:44,832 --> 02:15:48,836
Anybody with a match
can turn a house to smoke.

1184
02:15:50,925 --> 02:15:52,666
But a Mother Box...

1185
02:15:52,840 --> 02:15:55,016
...turns smoke
back into a house.

1186
02:16:01,065 --> 02:16:03,503
I know we're all thinking
the same thing right now.

1187
02:16:05,026 --> 02:16:07,463
Who's gonna say it?
I'm not gonna say it.

1188
02:16:34,795 --> 02:16:35,839
Who is it?

1189
02:16:36,579 --> 02:16:37,711
Martha.

1190
02:16:42,498 --> 02:16:43,717
Hi.

1191
02:16:45,632 --> 02:16:46,981
Hi.

1192
02:16:56,164 --> 02:16:57,600
I went to the Daily Planet

1193
02:16:57,774 --> 02:17:01,125
to finally pick up
Clark's things.

1194
02:17:02,649 --> 02:17:05,913
I don't know why,
nowhere to put them now.

1195
02:17:08,742 --> 02:17:10,309
I lost the farm.

1196
02:17:12,006 --> 02:17:14,051
I'd been behind on
the payments for a while.

1197
02:17:15,488 --> 02:17:16,967
Truth is, the house is too big

1198
02:17:17,141 --> 02:17:19,796
for me to live in
by myself anyway.

1199
02:17:19,970 --> 02:17:22,712
Well, you know you're welcome
to stay here any time

1200
02:17:22,886 --> 02:17:24,801
for as long as you need.

1201
02:17:26,063 --> 02:17:28,588
Thank you, Lois.
That's very kind.

1202
02:17:30,372 --> 02:17:32,492
But I've found a little place
that suits me just fine,

1203
02:17:32,592 --> 02:17:34,507
right by the diner.

1204
02:17:34,681 --> 02:17:35,986
I'm not here for help.

1205
02:17:37,205 --> 02:17:39,773
I'm here because

1206
02:17:39,947 --> 02:17:42,297
when I saw Mr. Perry,
he told me that

1207
02:17:43,820 --> 02:17:46,693
you haven't been to work
since Clark died.

1208
02:17:51,524 --> 02:17:53,134
I can't.

1209
02:18:00,054 --> 02:18:02,622
The whole world is mourning.

1210
02:18:04,014 --> 02:18:06,452
Grieving over a symbol.

1211
02:18:06,626 --> 02:18:10,325
Everywhere I go, everywhere
I look, I see that "S."

1212
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:13,502
I hear what people say.

1213
02:18:13,676 --> 02:18:15,417
They talk like they knew him.

1214
02:18:16,723 --> 02:18:18,942
But they didn't know Clark.

1215
02:18:20,509 --> 02:18:22,903
And I can't stop them

1216
02:18:23,077 --> 02:18:27,299
and look at them and tell them
how proud I am of my son.

1217
02:18:29,344 --> 02:18:31,825
You're the only one who knows.

1218
02:18:31,999 --> 02:18:34,349
Who feels what I do.

1219
02:18:35,742 --> 02:18:38,658
Burdened by a secret
on top of grief.

1220
02:18:41,878 --> 02:18:45,186
I came all this way
because I wanted...

1221
02:18:45,360 --> 02:18:47,319
because I wanted to see you.

1222
02:18:48,581 --> 02:18:50,539
Tell you...

1223
02:18:50,713 --> 02:18:52,498
I understand.

1224
02:18:54,500 --> 02:18:56,719
I...

1225
02:18:56,893 --> 02:19:00,332
will never love anybody
the way that I love your son.

1226
02:19:04,161 --> 02:19:06,120
And I just miss him.

1227
02:19:07,295 --> 02:19:09,819
I miss him so much.

1228
02:19:16,217 --> 02:19:17,871
So do I, sweetheart.

1229
02:19:22,745 --> 02:19:27,315
Martha, you know if there's
anything you need, I'm here.

1230
02:19:30,971 --> 02:19:33,495
There is something
you can do for me, honey.

1231
02:19:35,976 --> 02:19:38,195
Come back to the living.

1232
02:20:18,235 --> 02:20:21,021
The world
needs you, too, Lois.

1233
02:20:24,851 --> 02:20:26,200
The dead are dead.

1234
02:20:26,374 --> 02:20:28,115
The box brought Victor back.

1235
02:20:28,289 --> 02:20:29,812
Victor wasn't dead.

1236
02:20:29,986 --> 02:20:31,727
Life is either one or zero.

1237
02:20:31,901 --> 02:20:34,817
It's to be or not to be.
Not both.

1238
02:20:34,991 --> 02:20:36,515
Can you operate this box,
Victor?

1239
02:20:36,689 --> 02:20:38,255
Of course.

1240
02:20:38,430 --> 02:20:40,562
But we don't know enough
about Kryptonian biology.

1241
02:20:40,736 --> 02:20:42,477
There's no telling
what's gonna happen.

1242
02:20:44,523 --> 02:20:46,003
Okay, but...

1243
02:20:46,176 --> 02:20:50,224
I mean, we have to try.
Don't we? We have to try.

1244
02:20:50,398 --> 02:20:51,791
What do we have to lose?

1245
02:20:51,965 --> 02:20:54,228
We cannot try
unless we activate the box.

1246
02:20:54,402 --> 02:20:55,838
As soon as it wakes up...

1247
02:20:56,012 --> 02:20:58,406
...the enemy sees it, comes,

1248
02:20:58,580 --> 02:21:01,104
activates The Unity.
The end.

1249
02:21:01,278 --> 02:21:03,672
So, what we have to lose
is the entire planet

1250
02:21:03,846 --> 02:21:05,846
to a bunch of genocidal aliens.
That's good to know.

1251
02:21:05,935 --> 02:21:08,460
Even if Superman could return,

1252
02:21:08,634 --> 02:21:10,462
who's to say
that he could defeat them?

1253
02:21:10,636 --> 02:21:12,638
The Mother Box did.

1254
02:21:12,812 --> 02:21:14,988
Victor's father
activated a Mother Box

1255
02:21:15,162 --> 02:21:17,991
more than a year ago
when Superman was still alive.

1256
02:21:18,165 --> 02:21:19,949
Didn't call out
to Steppenwolf.

1257
02:21:20,123 --> 02:21:21,560
None of the boxes did.
Not until...

1258
02:21:21,734 --> 02:21:23,823
Not until Superman died.

1259
02:21:23,997 --> 02:21:26,434
Not until Superman died.

1260
02:21:26,608 --> 02:21:28,480
It's like they were
afraid of him?

1261
02:21:28,654 --> 02:21:31,439
Yes,
they were afraid of him.

1262
02:21:34,398 --> 02:21:36,183
This is the only way.

1263
02:21:37,924 --> 02:21:41,580
There are six, not five.
There is no us without him.

1264
02:21:58,031 --> 02:21:59,989
Cross this one off
the bucket list.

1265
02:22:00,163 --> 02:22:03,906
Exhume Superman
from the grave. Check.

1266
02:22:06,039 --> 02:22:08,389
You know we could do this
in a nanosecond, right?

1267
02:22:09,129 --> 02:22:10,478
We could.

1268
02:22:18,051 --> 02:22:19,618
He was my hero.

1269
02:22:22,272 --> 02:22:23,491
All right.

1270
02:22:27,147 --> 02:22:30,150
An Amazon
working with an Atlantean.

1271
02:22:30,324 --> 02:22:31,543
Half-Atlantean.

1272
02:22:33,501 --> 02:22:36,765
How many thousands of years
since our people spoke?

1273
02:22:36,939 --> 02:22:40,856
I don't know.
I'm not exactly close to mine.

1274
02:22:41,030 --> 02:22:43,685
I hate Atlanteans as much
as you Amazons do.

1275
02:22:43,859 --> 02:22:45,861
Hate is useless.

1276
02:22:49,038 --> 02:22:50,300
Yep.

1277
02:22:51,650 --> 02:22:53,216
No, thank you.

1278
02:22:57,786 --> 02:22:58,874
You know, my father told me

1279
02:22:59,048 --> 02:23:00,702
there's a saying
in Atlantis...

1280
02:23:02,530 --> 02:23:04,619
"None are taken back
from the darkness.

1281
02:23:04,793 --> 02:23:06,099
"Not without..."

1282
02:23:06,273 --> 02:23:07,753
"Not without
giving one up in return."

1283
02:23:09,842 --> 02:23:11,365
We say the same thing.

1284
02:23:14,063 --> 02:23:15,717
How about that?

1285
02:23:15,891 --> 02:23:17,719
Wonder Woman.

1286
02:23:19,155 --> 02:23:20,548
What do you think, man?

1287
02:23:20,722 --> 02:23:23,333
You think she'd ever
go for a younger guy?

1288
02:23:23,507 --> 02:23:26,032
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

1289
02:23:27,947 --> 02:23:29,731
Every guy's a younger guy.

1290
02:23:31,777 --> 02:23:32,778
Jesus.

1291
02:23:34,344 --> 02:23:36,042
Oh, Christ.

1292
02:23:38,653 --> 02:23:41,003
Oh, bloody...

1293
02:23:42,396 --> 02:23:43,397
Any luck?

1294
02:23:43,571 --> 02:23:44,964
If by "luck" you mean

1295
02:23:45,138 --> 02:23:47,923
"chance in hell
we'll get it flying today,"

1296
02:23:48,097 --> 02:23:50,056
then, no. No luck.

1297
02:23:50,970 --> 02:23:52,536
It's okay.

1298
02:23:52,711 --> 02:23:54,514
It doesn't matter.
We're just gonna take the body

1299
02:23:54,538 --> 02:23:55,801
to the Kryptonian ship.

1300
02:23:55,975 --> 02:23:57,335
It's basically
an organic computer.

1301
02:23:57,411 --> 02:23:58,978
It can talk directly
to the Mother Box.

1302
02:23:59,152 --> 02:24:01,589
What? The way it talked
to Lex Luthor?

1303
02:24:01,763 --> 02:24:03,199
Something like that.

1304
02:24:03,373 --> 02:24:06,768
Huh.
What could possibly go wrong?

1305
02:24:13,427 --> 02:24:14,907
Master Wayne...

1306
02:24:17,039 --> 02:24:18,475
you did it!

1307
02:24:18,650 --> 02:24:22,044
You put the team together
to fight this war.

1308
02:24:22,218 --> 02:24:25,352
You've fulfilled your promise.

1309
02:24:25,526 --> 02:24:29,399
But to try to do that...
I mean...

1310
02:24:29,573 --> 02:24:32,446
your guilt's
overcome your reason.

1311
02:24:32,620 --> 02:24:34,753
Not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men...

1312
02:24:34,927 --> 02:24:37,973
Alfred, for once,
I'm operating strictly on faith,

1313
02:24:38,147 --> 02:24:40,628
not on reason.

1314
02:24:40,802 --> 02:24:45,024
But if you start playing with
this little box of tricks,

1315
02:24:45,198 --> 02:24:47,243
I mean, it could be
the end of everything.

1316
02:24:47,417 --> 02:24:50,377
How do you know
your team's strong enough?

1317
02:24:50,551 --> 02:24:52,858
If you can't bring down
the charging bull,

1318
02:24:53,032 --> 02:24:54,729
then don't wave
the red cape at it.

1319
02:24:54,903 --> 02:24:56,513
You do
when it's this red cape.

1320
02:24:56,688 --> 02:24:58,777
This red cape charges back.

1321
02:25:13,530 --> 02:25:14,706
Okay.

1322
02:25:21,713 --> 02:25:24,063
You were right, Dr. Stone.
The tests came back negative.

1323
02:25:24,237 --> 02:25:25,978
Everyone's clear,
including you.

1324
02:25:26,152 --> 02:25:28,632
Just to be on the safe side,
we swept the entire facility.

1325
02:25:28,807 --> 02:25:30,480
Well, thank you, Thomas.
That means I'm free to go?

1326
02:25:30,504 --> 02:25:31,505
Absolutely.

1327
02:25:35,552 --> 02:25:36,858
- Thanks.
- Listen up, everyone.

1328
02:25:37,032 --> 02:25:39,469
You're all clear.
So, gather your things.

1329
02:25:39,643 --> 02:25:41,341
If you need
more medical attention...

1330
02:25:41,515 --> 02:25:44,997
Arthur, yes, your opinion.
Less preposterous. Option "A"?

1331
02:25:45,171 --> 02:25:46,389
- Definitely not "A."
- Okay.

1332
02:25:46,563 --> 02:25:49,697
Or... "B"?

1333
02:25:51,351 --> 02:25:52,569
Let me see "A" again?

1334
02:25:58,227 --> 02:26:01,317
Right. We should get dressed.

1335
02:26:03,493 --> 02:26:05,408
I'm always dressed.

1336
02:26:32,566 --> 02:26:33,654
ID?

1337
02:26:33,828 --> 02:26:34,960
ID.

1338
02:26:38,180 --> 02:26:39,268
Aye, aye.

1339
02:26:41,662 --> 02:26:42,794
"Aye, aye"?

1340
02:27:06,078 --> 02:27:07,427
Okay.

1341
02:27:07,601 --> 02:27:09,603
"Okay"? Oh, gee, okay!

1342
02:27:16,610 --> 02:27:17,741
Doc!

1343
02:27:17,916 --> 02:27:19,221
They let you out
of quarantine.

1344
02:27:19,395 --> 02:27:21,112
Yeah, I finally got them
to listen to reason.

1345
02:27:21,136 --> 02:27:23,071
Now, let's take a look and see
what progress we've made

1346
02:27:23,095 --> 02:27:24,487
with the electron-laser.

1347
02:27:24,661 --> 02:27:26,576
We've made some real progress.
Let me show you.

1348
02:27:41,765 --> 02:27:44,377
Victor, clear this place out.

1349
02:27:44,551 --> 02:27:46,031
Done.

1350
02:27:50,078 --> 02:27:52,646
Code Red.
Contamination breach.

1351
02:27:52,820 --> 02:27:56,084
All personnel
evacuate immediately.

1352
02:27:56,258 --> 02:27:58,347
Bio red five.

1353
02:27:58,521 --> 02:28:00,915
The sensor's picking up
a microbe of alien origin.

1354
02:28:01,089 --> 02:28:03,700
A microbe of alien origin?
That doesn't make any sense.

1355
02:28:03,875 --> 02:28:05,180
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1356
02:28:05,354 --> 02:28:07,356
All right, people,
shut it down. Let's go.

1357
02:28:07,530 --> 02:28:09,030
- Ryan, we just had it swept.
- We have to go, Doc.

1358
02:28:09,054 --> 02:28:10,335
Think about it.
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1359
02:28:10,359 --> 02:28:11,795
- Let's go, Doc.
- Think about it.

1360
02:28:11,970 --> 02:28:12,840
Full base evacuation!
Everyone out!

1361
02:28:12,841 --> 02:28:15,147
Look, wait! Wait! Shit!

1362
02:28:15,321 --> 02:28:17,932
Remain calm and
proceed to the nearest exit.

1363
02:28:24,504 --> 02:28:26,201
Attention, all personnel.

1364
02:28:26,375 --> 02:28:29,161
Go! Go! Everybody out!
Come on! Move!

1365
02:28:29,335 --> 02:28:30,945
Move! Come on! Go, go!

1366
02:28:31,119 --> 02:28:32,599
Everybody out! Go!

1367
02:28:53,098 --> 02:28:55,883
Yes! Gotcha!

1368
02:28:56,057 --> 02:28:58,712
Post Commander, this is
Dr. Silas Stone, do you read?

1369
02:28:58,886 --> 02:29:01,367
- Go ahead, Dr. Stone.
- This is a false alarm.

1370
02:29:01,541 --> 02:29:03,935
Someone has hacked into
the system. We must alert...

1371
02:29:13,988 --> 02:29:15,337
Victor.

1372
02:29:17,209 --> 02:29:19,298
Dr. Stone, you there?
I don't copy.

1373
02:29:20,386 --> 02:29:21,387
I was mistaken.

1374
02:29:21,561 --> 02:29:22,779
The alarm's legit.

1375
02:29:22,954 --> 02:29:24,520
Everybody out.
And nobody, I repeat,

1376
02:29:24,694 --> 02:29:27,436
nobody comes back inside
without my say-so.

1377
02:29:27,610 --> 02:29:28,785
Roger that, sir.

1378
02:29:39,144 --> 02:29:40,710
Get the civilians out!

1379
02:29:40,884 --> 02:29:42,124
Let's go! Let's go!

1380
02:29:46,281 --> 02:29:47,650
- Everybody got out okay?
- I think so.

1381
02:29:47,674 --> 02:29:48,674
- Everybody?
- Yes.

1382
02:30:21,969 --> 02:30:23,188
This way.

1383
02:30:33,850 --> 02:30:36,810
It knows he's here.

1384
02:30:36,984 --> 02:30:38,899
Ooh, that's intense.

1385
02:30:43,425 --> 02:30:45,253
This is amazing.

1386
02:30:46,124 --> 02:30:47,342
This is crazy.

1387
02:30:47,516 --> 02:30:49,388
Oh, what? Now it's crazy?

1388
02:30:49,562 --> 02:30:51,912
You two lunatics
better know what you're doing.

1389
02:33:17,927 --> 02:33:19,712
Systems coming online.

1390
02:33:22,671 --> 02:33:24,978
Welcome, Victor.

1391
02:33:25,152 --> 02:33:26,719
Would you like
to assume command?

1392
02:33:26,893 --> 02:33:27,894
I'm in.

1393
02:33:37,382 --> 02:33:39,558
The ship says
the Mother Box is hostile.

1394
02:33:39,732 --> 02:33:41,429
I can override
the security protocols,

1395
02:33:41,603 --> 02:33:43,364
but there's no time to repair
all the electrical damage

1396
02:33:43,388 --> 02:33:44,668
that Luthor's
power surges caused

1397
02:33:44,737 --> 02:33:45,757
to the primary capacitors.

1398
02:33:45,781 --> 02:33:47,218
English.

1399
02:33:47,392 --> 02:33:49,568
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

1400
02:33:49,742 --> 02:33:51,526
I might be able to do it.

1401
02:33:53,920 --> 02:33:55,835
I mean, I might be able
to jump-start it.

1402
02:33:56,009 --> 02:33:57,358
I don't like
to break this rule,

1403
02:33:57,532 --> 02:33:59,252
but when I approach
the speed of light, I...

1404
02:33:59,317 --> 02:34:00,840
Look, crazy things
happen to time,

1405
02:34:01,014 --> 02:34:03,582
but if I do it, I create
massive electrical power.

1406
02:34:03,756 --> 02:34:05,636
I could backtrack,
if I can get enough distance,

1407
02:34:05,671 --> 02:34:07,803
I can conduct a significant
electrical current.

1408
02:34:07,977 --> 02:34:10,545
I might be able to wake
the box, if that's...

1409
02:34:10,719 --> 02:34:12,286
still what we want?

1410
02:34:12,460 --> 02:34:13,809
It is. Do it.

1411
02:34:18,727 --> 02:34:19,815
Hey, Miss Lane.

1412
02:34:19,989 --> 02:34:21,077
Morning.

1413
02:34:21,252 --> 02:34:22,452
I didn't think
you were coming.

1414
02:34:23,471 --> 02:34:24,951
One last time.

1415
02:34:42,185 --> 02:34:45,841
I see engines, so this must be
the end of the line. So I'm...

1416
02:34:46,015 --> 02:34:47,079
I'm in position.

1417
02:34:49,976 --> 02:34:52,326
Ready to initiate
drop sequence.

1418
02:34:52,500 --> 02:34:54,067
The Mother Box is ready.

1419
02:35:13,608 --> 02:35:15,436
The ship's begging me
not to wake the box.

1420
02:35:15,610 --> 02:35:17,525
This action
is irreversible.

1421
02:35:17,699 --> 02:35:18,981
It's afraid.
It knows Steppenwolf will come for it.

1422
02:35:19,005 --> 02:35:20,833
We know that already.
Continue.

1423
02:35:21,007 --> 02:35:23,444
I strongly advise
against activation.

1424
02:35:23,618 --> 02:35:25,141
Barry, I'm initiating
the countdown.

1425
02:35:25,316 --> 02:35:26,882
This action
is irreversible.

1426
02:35:27,056 --> 02:35:28,319
- Five...
- Five...

1427
02:35:28,493 --> 02:35:29,853
- Five...
- Apokoliptian technology

1428
02:35:29,885 --> 02:35:31,080
- is hostile.
- This is a bad idea.

1429
02:35:31,103 --> 02:35:31,669
No, it isn't.
Keep going.

1430
02:35:31,670 --> 02:35:32,714
Four...

1431
02:35:32,888 --> 02:35:34,586
- Four...
- Four...

1432
02:35:34,760 --> 02:35:36,041
I strongly advise
against activation.

1433
02:35:36,065 --> 02:35:37,545
- We need to abort, now.
- Just do it.

1434
02:35:37,589 --> 02:35:38,503
- Three...
- Three...

1435
02:35:38,504 --> 02:35:39,504
Three...

1436
02:35:39,678 --> 02:35:41,549
- Two...
- Two...

1437
02:35:41,723 --> 02:35:43,290
- Two...
- This course is irreversible.

1438
02:35:43,464 --> 02:35:44,596
- One.
- One.

1439
02:35:45,727 --> 02:35:47,207
One.

1440
02:35:47,381 --> 02:35:48,576
This action
is irreversible.

1441
02:37:17,776 --> 02:37:19,176
- Victor?
- No.

1442
02:37:19,908 --> 02:37:20,908
Go?

1443
02:38:51,870 --> 02:38:54,481
The future has taken root
in the present.

1444
02:38:54,655 --> 02:38:56,178
Get down!

1445
02:40:40,326 --> 02:40:41,849
He's back.

1446
02:41:08,963 --> 02:41:11,574
Something's wrong.
He's scanning us.

1447
02:41:13,751 --> 02:41:15,100
What?

1448
02:41:30,202 --> 02:41:31,202
Victor?

1449
02:41:32,465 --> 02:41:33,466
Victor?

1450
02:41:35,816 --> 02:41:37,600
- Shit.
- What are you doing?

1451
02:41:37,775 --> 02:41:39,341
It's my auto-defense system.

1452
02:41:39,515 --> 02:41:40,516
It senses danger.

1453
02:41:40,691 --> 02:41:42,040
Victor, no! Victor!

1454
02:41:42,214 --> 02:41:43,854
- I can't control it.
- Don't!

1455
02:41:56,315 --> 02:41:57,446
Kal-El, no!

1456
02:42:05,890 --> 02:42:07,718
He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.

1457
02:42:14,986 --> 02:42:17,597
Arthur,
we need to restrain him.

1458
02:42:48,193 --> 02:42:51,762
Kal-El,
the last Son of Krypton...

1459
02:42:52,893 --> 02:42:55,026
remember who you are.

1460
02:42:56,723 --> 02:42:58,029
Tell me who you...

1461
02:44:32,950 --> 02:44:35,953
Let's go!

1462
02:44:43,221 --> 02:44:44,787
You should probably move.

1463
02:44:48,139 --> 02:44:49,314
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1464
02:44:49,488 --> 02:44:52,186
Get up.
Take cover back there. Go.

1465
02:45:44,195 --> 02:45:46,153
Please don't make me do this.

1466
02:46:18,925 --> 02:46:20,013
Clark.

1467
02:46:21,145 --> 02:46:22,276
Clark, no.

1468
02:46:33,853 --> 02:46:35,115
Clark.

1469
02:46:35,289 --> 02:46:37,117
No.

1470
02:46:37,291 --> 02:46:38,989
This world needs you.

1471
02:46:44,255 --> 02:46:45,430
Clark.

1472
02:46:45,604 --> 02:46:46,909
Clark.

1473
02:46:47,084 --> 02:46:48,868
Whoa! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

1474
02:46:50,609 --> 02:46:51,653
Clark.

1475
02:46:55,092 --> 02:46:56,441
Please.

1476
02:47:30,692 --> 02:47:31,824
Please.

1477
02:47:43,053 --> 02:47:44,141
Please.

1478
02:47:44,967 --> 02:47:47,057
Just go.

1479
02:47:47,231 --> 02:47:48,231
Yeah.

1480
02:47:49,102 --> 02:47:50,364
Let's go.

1481
02:48:22,962 --> 02:48:25,182
I'm so sorry.

1482
02:48:34,539 --> 02:48:35,583
Take cover!

1483
02:48:35,757 --> 02:48:38,108
- He's coming.
- The Mother Box.

1484
02:48:38,282 --> 02:48:39,283
Where is it?

1485
02:48:49,945 --> 02:48:51,121
Come on.

1486
02:48:52,122 --> 02:48:54,124
Come on.

1487
02:49:19,018 --> 02:49:22,456
Attention,
security breach detected.

1488
02:49:22,630 --> 02:49:24,806
Sector Four, Level Three.

1489
02:49:24,980 --> 02:49:27,722
Implement lockdown
procedures immediately.

1490
02:49:56,316 --> 02:49:57,839
Give me the Mother Box.

1491
02:50:11,070 --> 02:50:12,463
No, no, no.

1492
02:50:15,030 --> 02:50:16,728
Dad, wait! Don't!

1493
02:50:57,072 --> 02:50:59,945
So begins the end.

1494
02:51:05,733 --> 02:51:06,995
Victor?

1495
02:51:09,607 --> 02:51:12,653
Vic... Whoa, Victor.
Are you okay, man? Come on.

1496
02:51:18,703 --> 02:51:19,834
Victor?

1497
02:51:20,966 --> 02:51:22,446
He's dead.

1498
02:51:22,620 --> 02:51:23,620
What?

1499
02:51:24,709 --> 02:51:25,884
My father.

1500
02:51:27,364 --> 02:51:30,976
I didn't save him. I couldn't.

1501
02:51:31,150 --> 02:51:32,369
Oh, my God.

1502
02:51:39,376 --> 02:51:41,465
His father's dead
'cause of us.

1503
02:51:41,639 --> 02:51:43,181
I told you waking that box
was a bad idea.

1504
02:51:43,205 --> 02:51:44,816
It wasn't a bad idea.

1505
02:51:44,990 --> 02:51:47,340
We needed Superman.
We still do.

1506
02:51:47,514 --> 02:51:49,777
Well, whatever returned,
it isn't Superman.

1507
02:51:49,951 --> 02:51:52,954
His body and powers, maybe.
But it ain't him.

1508
02:51:53,128 --> 02:51:54,739
It is him.

1509
02:51:54,913 --> 02:51:57,263
He recognized Lois Lane.

1510
02:51:57,437 --> 02:51:59,526
- Who?
- The woman he loves.

1511
02:51:59,700 --> 02:52:02,094
- He remembers her.
- Nah.

1512
02:52:02,268 --> 02:52:04,108
He went to her 'cause
she wasn't afraid of him.

1513
02:52:04,183 --> 02:52:05,532
It's called instinct, Diana.

1514
02:52:13,018 --> 02:52:14,846
Wait,
where did Steppenwolf go?

1515
02:52:15,020 --> 02:52:16,620
He's gone back to his base

1516
02:52:16,674 --> 02:52:18,371
to assemble the three boxes.

1517
02:52:18,545 --> 02:52:20,044
And we don't know
where his base is.

1518
02:52:20,068 --> 02:52:21,628
- Or how long until...
- Hours.

1519
02:52:21,766 --> 02:52:23,463
The boxes synchronize,
Unity forms,

1520
02:52:23,637 --> 02:52:26,597
we don't get there in time
to stop it, the planet dies.

1521
02:52:26,771 --> 02:52:28,773
This is not your...

1522
02:52:30,949 --> 02:52:32,603
He knew.

1523
02:52:32,777 --> 02:52:34,387
He knew, he knew, he knew.

1524
02:52:34,561 --> 02:52:36,215
He wasn't trying
to destroy the box...

1525
02:52:36,389 --> 02:52:38,304
he was trying to superheat it.

1526
02:52:38,478 --> 02:52:39,798
He made the core
the hottest thing

1527
02:52:39,914 --> 02:52:41,283
on Earth outside
of a nuclear reactor.

1528
02:52:41,307 --> 02:52:42,458
Now, anything that hot
would have to...

1529
02:52:42,482 --> 02:52:43,503
Blink off the charts

1530
02:52:43,527 --> 02:52:45,746
on a thermal imaging system.

1531
02:52:45,920 --> 02:52:49,271
Your father sacrificed himself
to mark that box.

1532
02:52:49,446 --> 02:52:51,446
We have to get back to my lab
and use the satellite

1533
02:52:51,491 --> 02:52:53,450
to scan the Earth
for thermal anomalies.

1534
02:52:53,624 --> 02:52:55,060
I'm already on it.

1535
02:52:55,234 --> 02:52:56,954
I'm sorry.
You have a satellite?

1536
02:52:57,062 --> 02:52:58,411
I have six.

1537
02:52:58,585 --> 02:52:59,586
Right.

1538
02:53:01,458 --> 02:53:03,373
Let's go find
the son of a bitch.

1539
02:53:28,006 --> 02:53:30,051
You brought us here.

1540
02:53:30,225 --> 02:53:31,401
You remembered.

1541
02:53:32,314 --> 02:53:33,925
This is home.

1542
02:53:35,883 --> 02:53:37,058
You spoke.

1543
02:53:41,149 --> 02:53:42,977
Did I not before?

1544
02:54:17,011 --> 02:54:19,492
Your mother got behind
on the payments.

1545
02:54:21,059 --> 02:54:23,017
She never told anyone.

1546
02:54:24,715 --> 02:54:26,456
I don't understand.

1547
02:54:29,546 --> 02:54:31,939
She's a proud woman, Clark.

1548
02:54:35,073 --> 02:54:36,466
Here.

1549
02:54:51,393 --> 02:54:53,047
She loved it here.

1550
02:55:03,884 --> 02:55:05,495
So did I.

1551
02:55:07,497 --> 02:55:08,889
So did I.

1552
02:55:34,567 --> 02:55:35,873
Wow!

1553
02:55:36,047 --> 02:55:37,657
This is awesome.

1554
02:55:37,831 --> 02:55:39,311
Brought some friends.

1555
02:55:45,883 --> 02:55:48,494
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

1556
02:55:48,668 --> 02:55:51,149
Everyone, this is Alfred.
I work for him.

1557
02:55:51,323 --> 02:55:53,499
- Alfred.
- Good day, ma'am.

1558
02:55:54,805 --> 02:55:56,981
Oh...

1559
02:55:59,984 --> 02:56:01,812
It's badass, Alfred.

1560
02:56:04,641 --> 02:56:07,034
Well, I'll put on the tea.

1561
02:56:07,208 --> 02:56:08,688
Great.

1562
02:56:08,862 --> 02:56:10,622
I don't know where
we're gonna find the cups.

1563
02:56:13,171 --> 02:56:16,000
There's the
Mother Box, right there.

1564
02:56:16,174 --> 02:56:17,915
Go to visible spectrum.

1565
02:56:20,004 --> 02:56:22,093
Pozharnov.

1566
02:56:22,267 --> 02:56:25,096
Ghost city
not far from Moscow.

1567
02:56:25,270 --> 02:56:26,619
It's been abandoned since

1568
02:56:26,793 --> 02:56:28,075
the nuclear accident there
30 years ago.

1569
02:56:28,099 --> 02:56:29,491
Not even the army goes in.

1570
02:56:29,666 --> 02:56:31,208
Right, it's probably
so radioactive

1571
02:56:31,232 --> 02:56:33,017
that you grow an extra foot
outta your neck.

1572
02:56:33,191 --> 02:56:34,671
Not anymore.

1573
02:56:34,845 --> 02:56:36,300
He's harvested the radiation
to build his base.

1574
02:56:36,324 --> 02:56:37,325
Zoom.

1575
02:56:41,460 --> 02:56:42,809
What the hell is he building?

1576
02:56:42,983 --> 02:56:44,245
The Unity's in there.

1577
02:56:44,419 --> 02:56:45,812
We'll attack from above.

1578
02:56:45,986 --> 02:56:48,554
Explosives won't
separate the boxes,

1579
02:56:48,728 --> 02:56:50,600
only strengthen their bond.

1580
02:56:50,774 --> 02:56:52,012
What?
So we can't blow it up?

1581
02:56:52,036 --> 02:56:53,472
Not from the outside.

1582
02:56:55,126 --> 02:56:57,432
I want to plug into
The Unity, one-on-one.

1583
02:56:58,172 --> 02:56:59,565
Fuse with it.

1584
02:56:59,739 --> 02:57:00,958
Weaken its bond
from the inside

1585
02:57:01,132 --> 02:57:02,568
so we can break it back
into three.

1586
02:57:02,742 --> 02:57:04,701
No, you don't know
what you'd be up against.

1587
02:57:04,875 --> 02:57:08,400
You'd have to stream
into The Unity by yourself.

1588
02:57:08,574 --> 02:57:10,881
These boxes together
are world destroyers.

1589
02:57:11,055 --> 02:57:12,491
A billion years old.

1590
02:57:12,665 --> 02:57:14,798
They'll get inside you
and find your weaknesses

1591
02:57:14,972 --> 02:57:17,104
and your fears,
and use them to destroy you.

1592
02:57:17,278 --> 02:57:19,367
Just get me in
and get me time.

1593
02:57:19,541 --> 02:57:20,673
You could die, Victor.

1594
02:57:20,847 --> 02:57:23,110
If I don't, we all die.
Period.

1595
02:57:27,898 --> 02:57:29,639
I got nothing left.

1596
02:57:35,079 --> 02:57:36,950
You wanted me
to use these gifts, right?

1597
02:57:40,084 --> 02:57:41,563
That's what I'm gonna do.

1598
02:57:41,738 --> 02:57:44,175
Okay. So...

1599
02:57:44,349 --> 02:57:45,909
if Victor wants
to try to save the world

1600
02:57:46,046 --> 02:57:47,657
by fusing
with the doom boxes,

1601
02:57:47,831 --> 02:57:50,137
I say we put him
in the doom boxes.

1602
02:57:50,311 --> 02:57:53,097
But getting him in
means attacking that base.

1603
02:57:53,271 --> 02:57:55,447
Fighting the devil
and his army

1604
02:57:55,621 --> 02:57:56,970
in hell.

1605
02:57:57,144 --> 02:57:59,103
I mean,
this guy's probably fought

1606
02:57:59,277 --> 02:58:01,540
hundreds of thousands
of other superbeings

1607
02:58:01,714 --> 02:58:03,387
on the other planets
he's destroyed, right?

1608
02:58:03,411 --> 02:58:04,935
And we have to assume
he's won.

1609
02:58:05,109 --> 02:58:06,669
I don't care
how many demons he's fought

1610
02:58:06,806 --> 02:58:08,199
in how many hells...

1611
02:58:08,373 --> 02:58:11,942
he's never fought us.
Not us united.

1612
02:59:02,340 --> 02:59:03,907
Take that as a "yes."

1613
02:59:04,081 --> 02:59:05,386
What?

1614
02:59:08,868 --> 02:59:10,043
The ring.

1615
02:59:13,830 --> 02:59:15,353
You're really back.

1616
02:59:48,865 --> 02:59:51,041
I have a second chance, Lo.

1617
02:59:53,391 --> 02:59:55,785
And I am not gonna waste it.

1618
03:00:54,104 --> 03:00:55,279
Are you really you?

1619
03:00:55,453 --> 03:00:57,107
I'm really me, Ma.

1620
03:01:15,168 --> 03:01:17,170
Listen, Ma.

1621
03:01:18,824 --> 03:01:20,826
They wanted me back
for a reason.

1622
03:01:22,610 --> 03:01:24,090
I need to find out why.

1623
03:01:44,284 --> 03:01:45,677
How's Victor doing?

1624
03:01:50,116 --> 03:01:52,814
You know,
wanted to be by himself.

1625
03:01:54,425 --> 03:01:57,602
We're asking a kid
who just lost his father

1626
03:01:57,776 --> 03:01:59,319
to go up against
the most powerful machines

1627
03:01:59,343 --> 03:02:00,518
in the universe.

1628
03:02:02,389 --> 03:02:03,869
It's not fair.

1629
03:02:05,653 --> 03:02:07,220
I thought you didn't care?

1630
03:02:08,700 --> 03:02:10,136
I never said that.

1631
03:02:23,106 --> 03:02:24,498
What is it?

1632
03:02:26,326 --> 03:02:28,285
Uh...

1633
03:02:28,459 --> 03:02:31,549
I had a dream,
like, I don't know,

1634
03:02:31,723 --> 03:02:34,247
almost like a premonition.

1635
03:02:34,421 --> 03:02:37,207
It was the end of the world

1636
03:02:37,381 --> 03:02:40,210
and Barry Allen
was right here

1637
03:02:40,384 --> 03:02:44,214
and he said to me,
"Lois Lane is the key."

1638
03:02:46,912 --> 03:02:50,089
She is... to Superman.

1639
03:02:51,177 --> 03:02:53,266
Every heart has one.

1640
03:02:53,440 --> 03:02:55,268
I think it's something more.

1641
03:02:56,182 --> 03:02:58,010
Something darker.

1642
03:03:02,232 --> 03:03:03,233
Master Wayne.

1643
03:03:03,407 --> 03:03:05,583
Master Wayne!

1644
03:03:05,757 --> 03:03:07,367
You need to see this.

1645
03:03:30,695 --> 03:03:32,392
You fixed it.

1646
03:03:32,566 --> 03:03:34,220
It wanted to fly.

1647
03:03:35,526 --> 03:03:36,831
Flight is its nature.

1648
03:03:37,006 --> 03:03:38,268
Yours, too.

1649
03:03:45,144 --> 03:03:47,059
He'll be here, Alfred,
I know it.

1650
03:03:47,233 --> 03:03:49,453
What makes you so sure?

1651
03:03:49,627 --> 03:03:52,151
Faith, Alfred. Faith.

1652
03:04:14,304 --> 03:04:15,870
At last.

1653
03:04:17,742 --> 03:04:20,397
Prepare for his arrival.

1654
03:04:22,268 --> 03:04:26,359
My redemption is nigh.

1655
03:04:34,280 --> 03:04:35,716
Unite.

1656
03:04:40,895 --> 03:04:43,376
Synchronize.

1657
03:05:27,768 --> 03:05:28,987
The satellites revealed

1658
03:05:29,161 --> 03:05:30,684
he's created a defensive dome.

1659
03:05:30,858 --> 03:05:32,208
It's a design flaw.

1660
03:05:32,382 --> 03:05:34,471
Take out the tower,
the dome will fall.

1661
03:05:34,645 --> 03:05:36,603
The enemy never anticipated
a frontal assault.

1662
03:05:36,777 --> 03:05:38,320
Right, probably
'cause he didn't think

1663
03:05:38,344 --> 03:05:40,216
anyone would be that nuts.

1664
03:05:41,260 --> 03:05:42,566
Bruce is right.

1665
03:05:42,740 --> 03:05:44,350
We've got to destroy
the defensive dome

1666
03:05:44,524 --> 03:05:46,787
so we can reach The Unity
before it synchronizes.

1667
03:05:46,961 --> 03:05:48,659
What if the dome's
not destroyed?

1668
03:05:48,833 --> 03:05:50,313
It'll be destroyed.

1669
03:05:50,487 --> 03:05:52,073
Once Victor
is linked with The Unity

1670
03:05:52,097 --> 03:05:53,490
with Barry's help,

1671
03:05:53,664 --> 03:05:55,405
he'll break through
The Unity's defenses.

1672
03:05:55,579 --> 03:05:57,059
Remind me,
how's that again?

1673
03:05:57,189 --> 03:05:58,712
Uh, with the power of love.

1674
03:05:58,886 --> 03:06:01,541
- Barry.
- With a catastrophic energy surge.

1675
03:06:01,715 --> 03:06:03,282
Good.

1676
03:06:03,456 --> 03:06:05,217
You'll have to run faster
than you've ever attempted

1677
03:06:05,241 --> 03:06:07,547
to generate
a charge of that size.

1678
03:06:07,721 --> 03:06:09,854
And then you make
physical contact with Victor.

1679
03:06:10,028 --> 03:06:12,900
That force should propel him
inside The Unity.

1680
03:06:13,074 --> 03:06:14,946
And, Victor,
it's all up to you.

1681
03:06:15,120 --> 03:06:18,384
Take it apart from the inside
before it synchronizes.

1682
03:06:18,558 --> 03:06:21,909
Whew. We actually
finally have a plan.

1683
03:06:22,083 --> 03:06:23,781
We have a plan.

1684
03:06:39,188 --> 03:06:41,233
The symbol of the house
of El means hope.

1685
03:06:41,407 --> 03:06:43,583
Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief

1686
03:06:43,757 --> 03:06:47,413
in the potential of every person
to be a force for good.

1687
03:06:47,587 --> 03:06:49,110
Clark...

1688
03:06:49,285 --> 03:06:50,845
That's what
you can bring them.

1689
03:06:50,982 --> 03:06:52,699
...you were
sent here for a reason.

1690
03:06:52,723 --> 03:06:54,179
You will give
the people of Earth

1691
03:06:54,203 --> 03:06:56,248
an ideal to strive towards.

1692
03:06:56,422 --> 03:06:57,486
And even if it takes you

1693
03:06:57,510 --> 03:06:59,382
the rest of your life,

1694
03:06:59,556 --> 03:07:02,515
you owe it to yourself to
find out what that reason is.

1695
03:07:02,689 --> 03:07:05,301
They will stumble,
they will fall.

1696
03:07:05,475 --> 03:07:07,433
You're gonna
have to make a choice.

1697
03:07:07,607 --> 03:07:10,001
They will join you
in the sun, Kal.

1698
03:07:10,175 --> 03:07:12,003
A choice
of whether to stand proud

1699
03:07:12,177 --> 03:07:14,135
in front of the human race
or not.

1700
03:07:14,310 --> 03:07:17,400
You will help them
accomplish wonders.

1701
03:07:34,634 --> 03:07:39,117
All the hopes and dreams
of Krypton live in you now.

1702
03:07:39,291 --> 03:07:42,686
I'm so proud of you, son.

1703
03:07:42,860 --> 03:07:45,384
Your mother and I
loved you.

1704
03:07:45,558 --> 03:07:46,951
Your mother and I knew

1705
03:07:47,125 --> 03:07:49,083
you would change the world.

1706
03:07:50,433 --> 03:07:53,392
Your heart was tested.

1707
03:07:53,566 --> 03:07:56,090
I know
it's been hard, Clark.

1708
03:07:56,265 --> 03:07:59,180
But you gave hope
to their world.

1709
03:07:59,355 --> 03:08:02,532
You need
to show them who you are.

1710
03:08:02,706 --> 03:08:04,882
Love them, Kal.

1711
03:08:05,056 --> 03:08:07,145
The way we loved you.

1712
03:08:09,626 --> 03:08:10,714
Fly, son.

1713
03:08:11,802 --> 03:08:12,977
It's time.

1714
03:09:16,780 --> 03:09:18,172
I'm gonna take out that tower

1715
03:09:18,347 --> 03:09:19,913
and knock down
that shield dome.

1716
03:09:20,087 --> 03:09:21,175
Whatever you see,

1717
03:09:22,525 --> 03:09:24,440
stick to the plan.

1718
03:09:26,398 --> 03:09:28,269
It's why
I brought you together.

1719
03:10:08,397 --> 03:10:10,094
Bruce, pull back.
You're not gonna make it.

1720
03:10:13,271 --> 03:10:15,926
Just have to knock
a little louder.

1721
03:10:40,951 --> 03:10:42,561
Kill him!

1722
03:10:42,735 --> 03:10:45,434
Get to the carriage.
Defend The Unity.

1723
03:10:50,308 --> 03:10:51,440
Oh, shit.

1724
03:11:11,677 --> 03:11:12,852
The tower's down.

1725
03:11:14,506 --> 03:11:16,377
Do you read me?

1726
03:11:16,552 --> 03:11:17,640
Uh, yeah, loud and clear.

1727
03:11:18,815 --> 03:11:20,120
Are you okay?

1728
03:11:21,382 --> 03:11:24,124
Bruce? Bruce?

1729
03:11:24,298 --> 03:11:25,561
Get to the reactor.

1730
03:11:25,735 --> 03:11:27,095
I'll lure as many
of these monsters

1731
03:11:27,258 --> 03:11:29,138
- away from you as I can.
- What does that mean?

1732
03:11:31,871 --> 03:11:33,743
Don't worry about me.
Get to The Unity.

1733
03:11:36,485 --> 03:11:37,529
They're here.

1734
03:11:37,703 --> 03:11:38,863
Bruce?

1735
03:11:41,881 --> 03:11:43,143
Comm went dead.

1736
03:11:44,884 --> 03:11:46,103
Let's go.

1737
03:12:25,055 --> 03:12:26,839
Come on, follow me,
you damn insects.

1738
03:13:46,876 --> 03:13:48,196
Critical damage.

1739
03:14:28,004 --> 03:14:29,222
You really are
outta your mind.

1740
03:14:56,162 --> 03:14:57,250
You're welcome.

1741
03:14:57,424 --> 03:14:59,078
My man.

1742
03:16:31,823 --> 03:16:33,477
Yeah, we got this.

1743
03:16:33,651 --> 03:16:34,913
You go do your thing.

1744
03:17:30,839 --> 03:17:32,275
I'm assuming you're Alfred.

1745
03:17:34,190 --> 03:17:35,452
Master Kent.

1746
03:17:37,541 --> 03:17:38,977
He said you'd come.

1747
03:17:40,761 --> 03:17:44,113
Now, let's hope
you're not too late.

1748
03:17:55,037 --> 03:17:57,256
Hey!

1749
03:18:05,395 --> 03:18:06,700
Remember me?

1750
03:18:09,268 --> 03:18:10,661
Round two?

1751
03:18:11,401 --> 03:18:12,532
Hell yeah.

1752
03:18:34,076 --> 03:18:35,425
Shall we?

1753
03:18:36,426 --> 03:18:38,732
Tell me, Amazon,

1754
03:18:38,907 --> 03:18:42,954
why did you
abandon your own sisters

1755
03:18:43,128 --> 03:18:45,565
only to cast your lot
with these creatures

1756
03:18:45,739 --> 03:18:49,047
clinging to their puny lives?

1757
03:18:49,221 --> 03:18:52,094
You weren't there
to protect them from me.

1758
03:18:52,268 --> 03:18:54,226
And, sadly, you could have.

1759
03:19:35,267 --> 03:19:36,965
Barry, I'm in position.

1760
03:19:55,766 --> 03:19:58,899
Okay.
I built the charge.

1761
03:19:59,074 --> 03:20:00,075
You call it.

1762
03:20:01,337 --> 03:20:03,078
Barry, on one.

1763
03:20:03,252 --> 03:20:05,515
Three, two...

1764
03:20:08,387 --> 03:20:10,085
Get the hell off me!

1765
03:20:10,259 --> 03:20:11,564
Victor!

1766
03:20:47,644 --> 03:20:49,167
Victor!

1767
03:20:53,084 --> 03:20:55,565
I watched your island burn,

1768
03:20:55,739 --> 03:20:59,177
your sisters
begging for their lives.

1769
03:20:59,351 --> 03:21:01,788
As did your mother.

1770
03:21:01,962 --> 03:21:02,963
Liar.

1771
03:21:28,728 --> 03:21:30,687
I can't maintain this!

1772
03:21:31,601 --> 03:21:32,601
Victor!

1773
03:21:54,841 --> 03:21:57,017
Victor, I can't hold this!

1774
03:22:03,720 --> 03:22:05,939
For Darkseid.

1775
03:22:09,900 --> 03:22:12,250
Not impressed.

1776
03:22:56,816 --> 03:22:57,904
All right.

1777
03:22:58,078 --> 03:22:59,645
Kal-El.

1778
03:23:38,249 --> 03:23:40,425
Barry, I'm connected
to The Unity.

1779
03:23:40,599 --> 03:23:42,514
I need the charge
to get inside.

1780
03:24:04,623 --> 03:24:05,623
Barry?

1781
03:24:06,538 --> 03:24:08,236
Barry, are you okay?

1782
03:24:09,846 --> 03:24:11,021
Barry!

1783
03:24:11,195 --> 03:24:12,475
I got the wind
knocked out of me.

1784
03:24:12,544 --> 03:24:14,894
Need a few seconds,
that's all!

1785
03:24:32,129 --> 03:24:34,436
Barry, where are you?
It's almost synchronized!

1786
03:24:34,610 --> 03:24:36,612
Okay, okay.

1787
03:24:36,786 --> 03:24:39,354
Oh, my God. Gotta heal, Barry.

1788
03:24:39,528 --> 03:24:41,181
Heal. Heal.

1789
03:25:07,033 --> 03:25:08,557
Barry!

1790
03:25:21,526 --> 03:25:23,223
It's too late.

1791
03:25:24,573 --> 03:25:25,965
Oh, no.

1792
03:25:30,187 --> 03:25:31,841
He's here!

1793
03:26:01,349 --> 03:26:02,698
Okay.

1794
03:26:02,872 --> 03:26:03,979
Just gotta go faster
than the speed of light.

1795
03:26:04,003 --> 03:26:05,203
Far beyond the speed of light.

1796
03:26:05,265 --> 03:26:06,571
You gotta break the rule,
Barry,

1797
03:26:06,745 --> 03:26:08,385
and you gotta do it now.

1798
03:26:21,412 --> 03:26:23,109
Dad...

1799
03:26:26,983 --> 03:26:29,289
whatever happens,
I want you to know

1800
03:26:32,031 --> 03:26:33,990
your kid was one of them, Dad.

1801
03:26:37,254 --> 03:26:39,125
One of the best of the best.

1802
03:27:34,572 --> 03:27:37,096
Make your own future.

1803
03:27:43,581 --> 03:27:45,496
Make your own past.

1804
03:27:50,153 --> 03:27:53,635
It's all right now.

1805
03:28:40,769 --> 03:28:42,858
We've been waiting
for you, Victor.

1806
03:28:44,033 --> 03:28:46,078
My broken boy.

1807
03:28:48,559 --> 03:28:50,518
You don't have to be
alone anymore.

1808
03:28:50,692 --> 03:28:52,345
We'll be together again.

1809
03:29:00,223 --> 03:29:02,268
we can put it back, Vic.

1810
03:29:06,621 --> 03:29:08,710
Make you whole again.

1811
03:29:20,591 --> 03:29:22,332
I'm not broken.

1812
03:29:32,081 --> 03:29:33,909
And I'm not alone.

1813
03:29:50,752 --> 03:29:51,752
Superman!

1814
03:31:22,408 --> 03:31:24,367
I told you

1815
03:31:25,977 --> 03:31:28,588
Steppenwolf would fail.

1816
03:31:29,546 --> 03:31:33,202
Yes. Yes, you did.

1817
03:31:33,942 --> 03:31:35,421
My master,

1818
03:31:35,595 --> 03:31:39,121
now that the Mother Boxes
have been destroyed,

1819
03:31:39,295 --> 03:31:43,125
how will you retrieve
your great prize?

1820
03:31:43,299 --> 03:31:46,737
Anti-Life is found, DeSaad.

1821
03:31:46,911 --> 03:31:51,524
And we will stop
at nothing to possess it.

1822
03:31:54,702 --> 03:31:56,138
Ready the armada.

1823
03:31:57,139 --> 03:31:59,532
We will use the old ways.

1824
03:34:23,938 --> 03:34:25,983
Your father twice over.

1825
03:34:33,382 --> 03:34:35,688
Now, let me speak to you
from my heart,

1826
03:34:35,863 --> 03:34:37,647
not as a scientist,

1827
03:34:37,821 --> 03:34:39,475
as a father.

1828
03:34:39,649 --> 03:34:42,739
Your father twice over.

1829
03:34:45,350 --> 03:34:48,745
I brought you into the world
and back to it.

1830
03:34:48,919 --> 03:34:52,880
You can't imagine how proud
I am of who you are.

1831
03:34:53,054 --> 03:34:54,620
Have always been.

1832
03:34:56,884 --> 03:34:58,189
So many years
with you I wasted.

1833
03:34:58,363 --> 03:35:01,714
So many wrongs
I've left un-righted.

1834
03:35:04,195 --> 03:35:06,502
Everything breaks, Victor.

1835
03:35:06,676 --> 03:35:08,896
Everything changes.

1836
03:35:19,602 --> 03:35:21,647
I gotta go see my father.

1837
03:35:57,248 --> 03:35:59,076
The world is hurt.

1838
03:35:59,250 --> 03:36:00,338
Broken.

1839
03:36:00,512 --> 03:36:02,950
Unexchangeable.

1840
03:36:03,124 --> 03:36:04,647
Ship's
all yours now, kid.

1841
03:36:04,821 --> 03:36:06,127
You're the boss.

1842
03:36:08,477 --> 03:36:11,610
"Ryan Choi,
Director of Nanotechnology."

1843
03:36:11,784 --> 03:36:13,264
That's your thing.

1844
03:36:13,961 --> 03:36:15,788
Uh, yep.

1845
03:36:15,963 --> 03:36:17,529
That's my thing.

1846
03:36:22,621 --> 03:36:26,625
But the world's
not fixed in the past,

1847
03:36:26,799 --> 03:36:27,931
only the future.

1848
03:36:29,846 --> 03:36:33,719
The not yet. The now.

1849
03:36:33,893 --> 03:36:37,245
Wow.
Must be 100, 150 feet.

1850
03:36:37,419 --> 03:36:38,724
Must be.

1851
03:36:39,856 --> 03:36:41,510
Big round table.

1852
03:36:41,684 --> 03:36:43,816
Six chairs, right there.

1853
03:36:44,948 --> 03:36:46,558
But room for more.

1854
03:36:48,996 --> 03:36:50,606
But room for more.

1855
03:36:51,650 --> 03:36:53,391
God help us.

1856
03:36:55,176 --> 03:36:57,134
The now is you.

1857
03:37:00,877 --> 03:37:02,618
What?

1858
03:37:02,792 --> 03:37:05,229
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

1859
03:37:05,403 --> 03:37:07,797
But, uh,
my foot's in the door.

1860
03:37:07,971 --> 03:37:09,494
This is like a "job" job?

1861
03:37:10,321 --> 03:37:11,409
"Job" job.

1862
03:37:15,152 --> 03:37:17,676
Your foot's in the door.

1863
03:37:20,070 --> 03:37:21,270
Isn't that a thing people say?

1864
03:37:21,332 --> 03:37:23,247
Your foot's in the door.

1865
03:37:23,421 --> 03:37:25,728
Yeah, that's something
people say, man.

1866
03:37:25,902 --> 03:37:27,619
His foot's in the door!

1867
03:37:27,643 --> 03:37:30,080
- That's my boy, right there!
- Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

1868
03:37:30,254 --> 03:37:31,603
Taught him nothing he knows.

1869
03:37:31,777 --> 03:37:32,798
- Yes!
- Dad, you're gonna

1870
03:37:32,822 --> 03:37:33,823
get maced again.

1871
03:37:37,305 --> 03:37:39,089
No stopping you now.

1872
03:37:41,135 --> 03:37:42,397
Thanks, Dad.

1873
03:37:42,571 --> 03:37:43,920
Now.

1874
03:37:44,094 --> 03:37:47,010
Now's your time, Victor,
to rise.

1875
03:37:47,184 --> 03:37:50,144
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.

1876
03:37:50,318 --> 03:37:53,625
I just undid a mistake,
that's all.

1877
03:38:04,114 --> 03:38:06,812
How did you get the house
back from the bank?

1878
03:38:06,986 --> 03:38:08,988
I bought the bank.

1879
03:38:11,426 --> 03:38:13,906
Congratulations, by the way.

1880
03:38:14,081 --> 03:38:15,821
Do this. Be this.

1881
03:38:15,995 --> 03:38:21,175
The man I never was.
The hero you are.

1882
03:38:21,349 --> 03:38:23,655
Take your place
among the brave ones.

1883
03:38:23,829 --> 03:38:28,617
The ones that were, that are,
that are yet to be.

1884
03:39:01,345 --> 03:39:04,218
It's time you stand,

1885
03:39:08,004 --> 03:39:09,484
fight,

1886
03:39:12,139 --> 03:39:13,531
discover,

1887
03:39:18,319 --> 03:39:20,364
heal, love,

1888
03:39:23,976 --> 03:39:25,021
win.

1889
03:39:51,656 --> 03:39:53,354
The time

1890
03:39:53,528 --> 03:39:54,877
is now.

1891
03:40:04,103 --> 03:40:05,322
Ready?

1892
03:40:05,496 --> 03:40:06,715
Come on, Stevens.

1893
03:40:10,762 --> 03:40:12,602
All right,
let's keep it moving.

1894
03:40:13,635 --> 03:40:14,723
Keep going.

1895
03:40:16,594 --> 03:40:18,274
Come on, Luthor. Let's go.

1896
03:40:21,947 --> 03:40:23,079
Luthor.

1897
03:40:28,127 --> 03:40:29,167
Open up two, Carl, please.

1898
03:40:38,268 --> 03:40:39,530
Luthor.

1899
03:40:44,666 --> 03:40:46,189
All right,
stop jerking around, Luthor,

1900
03:40:46,363 --> 03:40:47,799
or I'm gonna
have to come in there.

1901
03:42:16,453 --> 03:42:18,325
Ah, there he is.

1902
03:42:19,108 --> 03:42:20,414
Welcome aboard.

1903
03:42:20,588 --> 03:42:22,372
Care for a glass
of Gout de Diamants?

1904
03:42:22,546 --> 03:42:24,418
I was just celebrating
God's return.

1905
03:42:24,592 --> 03:42:27,116
Out of the ground
and back up into the sky.

1906
03:42:27,290 --> 03:42:29,660
I heard you were
a few clowns short of a circus.

1907
03:42:29,684 --> 03:42:31,381
I was, thank you,

1908
03:42:31,555 --> 03:42:33,557
until the good doctors
at Arkham helped me

1909
03:42:33,731 --> 03:42:35,820
find some much needed clarity.

1910
03:42:35,994 --> 03:42:38,083
Now, you volunteered
to destroy the bat

1911
03:42:38,257 --> 03:42:39,258
free of charge.

1912
03:42:39,433 --> 03:42:41,130
Why the pro bono work?

1913
03:42:41,304 --> 03:42:43,306
It's personal.

1914
03:42:43,480 --> 03:42:46,222
Ah, let me guess,
an eye for an eye?

1915
03:42:48,355 --> 03:42:50,052
You said you had something
I'd want?

1916
03:42:50,226 --> 03:42:51,626
You'd better not be
wasting my time.

1917
03:42:51,749 --> 03:42:53,795
Ooh. And endure
your wrath, Mr. Wilson?

1918
03:42:53,969 --> 03:42:55,710
No, I wouldn't think of it.

1919
03:42:55,884 --> 03:42:57,146
Uh, I have too much
to live for.

1920
03:42:57,320 --> 03:43:00,236
And more important things
to do.

1921
03:43:00,410 --> 03:43:03,892
But if you want the Batman,

1922
03:43:04,066 --> 03:43:07,112
here is something
that can help you.

1923
03:43:08,462 --> 03:43:12,553
His name is Bruce Wayne.

1924
03:43:15,817 --> 03:43:18,210
Hmm. On second thought,

1925
03:43:20,604 --> 03:43:22,432
we do have something
to celebrate.

1926
03:43:23,607 --> 03:43:25,000
Good boy.

1927
03:44:29,325 --> 03:44:30,500
Clear.

1928
03:44:36,071 --> 03:44:37,507
How much further?

1929
03:44:38,813 --> 03:44:39,988
We're almost there.

1930
03:44:42,294 --> 03:44:43,818
Well, we need to hurry.

1931
03:44:43,992 --> 03:44:45,552
We can't be out in the open
much longer.

1932
03:44:45,646 --> 03:44:47,256
He'll come for us.

1933
03:44:50,259 --> 03:44:52,217
Let him come.

1934
03:44:52,391 --> 03:44:53,958
Let the bastard come.

1935
03:44:55,482 --> 03:44:57,440
I'll stab this
through his heart

1936
03:44:57,614 --> 03:44:59,877
for what he did to Arthur.

1937
03:45:00,051 --> 03:45:01,923
I want to make him pay.

1938
03:45:03,707 --> 03:45:06,318
I understand
how you feel, Mera.

1939
03:45:06,493 --> 03:45:09,321
You have no idea how I feel.

1940
03:45:09,496 --> 03:45:11,280
But we have to
stick to the plan

1941
03:45:11,454 --> 03:45:13,630
to have any chance
to make this right.

1942
03:45:21,508 --> 03:45:24,902
Who have you ever loved?

1943
03:45:39,134 --> 03:45:42,224
Au contraire,
my little fish stick.

1944
03:45:46,010 --> 03:45:47,534
He knows exactly
what it's like

1945
03:45:47,708 --> 03:45:49,405
to lose someone he loves.

1946
03:45:51,407 --> 03:45:53,583
You know, like, uh,

1947
03:45:54,976 --> 03:45:56,325
a father,

1948
03:45:57,805 --> 03:45:59,981
like a mother.

1949
03:46:00,155 --> 03:46:03,158
Be very careful
with the next thing you say.

1950
03:46:04,855 --> 03:46:06,814
Like an adopted son.

1951
03:46:10,600 --> 03:46:12,210
Isn't that right,

1952
03:46:13,777 --> 03:46:15,213
Batman?

1953
03:46:18,477 --> 03:46:19,827
Maybe, in a way,

1954
03:46:20,001 --> 03:46:21,655
that smelly
old flounder is right.

1955
03:46:23,570 --> 03:46:26,224
Because how many
can die in your arms

1956
03:46:26,398 --> 03:46:27,791
before you grow numb to death?

1957
03:46:29,445 --> 03:46:32,404
That's not very careful.

1958
03:46:32,579 --> 03:46:36,234
And how many dead eyes
can you look into

1959
03:46:36,408 --> 03:46:39,150
before you die inside
yourself?

1960
03:46:39,324 --> 03:46:42,980
I've been dead inside
a long time,

1961
03:46:43,154 --> 03:46:45,113
but even I have a limit.

1962
03:46:45,287 --> 03:46:47,091
And if you cross that line,
I swear to God, I will...

1963
03:46:47,115 --> 03:46:49,944
Before what, Bruce? Kill me?

1964
03:46:50,118 --> 03:46:51,859
You won't kill me.

1965
03:46:52,773 --> 03:46:55,123
I'm your best friend.

1966
03:46:55,297 --> 03:46:59,257
Besides, who's gonna give you
a reach-around?

1967
03:47:01,259 --> 03:47:02,609
Anyway,

1968
03:47:03,958 --> 03:47:05,481
you need me.

1969
03:47:06,525 --> 03:47:08,440
You

1970
03:47:08,615 --> 03:47:11,400
need me to help you
undo this world

1971
03:47:11,574 --> 03:47:14,185
you created
by letting her die.

1972
03:47:16,797 --> 03:47:18,668
Poor Lois.

1973
03:47:18,842 --> 03:47:21,628
How she suffered so!

1974
03:47:27,503 --> 03:47:29,766
I often wonder

1975
03:47:29,940 --> 03:47:31,768
how many
alternate timelines

1976
03:47:31,942 --> 03:47:34,031
do you destroy
the world because...

1977
03:47:35,250 --> 03:47:36,730
frankly, you don't have

1978
03:47:36,904 --> 03:47:39,384
the cojones to die yourself.

1979
03:47:40,385 --> 03:47:41,778
Hmm?

1980
03:47:43,998 --> 03:47:45,173
So, as usual,

1981
03:47:45,347 --> 03:47:47,741
I'll be the bigger man.

1982
03:47:51,614 --> 03:47:53,050
A truce,

1983
03:47:53,921 --> 03:47:55,574
Bruce.

1984
03:47:58,012 --> 03:48:02,016
As long as you
have this card, a truce.

1985
03:48:05,106 --> 03:48:06,106
But all you have to do

1986
03:48:06,237 --> 03:48:07,456
is tear it in half

1987
03:48:07,630 --> 03:48:09,153
and I'm happy
to discuss with you

1988
03:48:09,327 --> 03:48:11,460
in any way you like,
why you sent the Boy Wonder

1989
03:48:13,244 --> 03:48:15,029
to do a man's job?

1990
03:48:18,510 --> 03:48:20,295
You know, it's funny

1991
03:48:20,469 --> 03:48:21,731
that you would talk
about people

1992
03:48:21,905 --> 03:48:23,515
who died in my arms

1993
03:48:23,690 --> 03:48:25,387
because when I held
Harley Quinn

1994
03:48:25,561 --> 03:48:27,998
and she was bleeding
and dying,

1995
03:48:28,172 --> 03:48:31,698
she begged me
with her last breath

1996
03:48:31,872 --> 03:48:34,135
that when I killed you,

1997
03:48:34,309 --> 03:48:37,704
and make no mistake,
I will fucking kill you...

1998
03:48:37,878 --> 03:48:39,706
that I'd do it slow.

1999
03:48:40,924 --> 03:48:42,839
I'm gonna honor that promise.

2000
03:49:13,478 --> 03:49:16,220
Oh. You're good.

2001
03:49:20,572 --> 03:49:22,096
You almost had me.

2002
03:49:41,637 --> 03:49:42,681
Where are we holing up?

2003
03:49:42,856 --> 03:49:45,423
Somewhere he'll never suspect.

2004
03:49:45,597 --> 03:49:48,426
Still think it was a good idea
bringing him along?

2005
03:49:48,600 --> 03:49:51,081
what do you think?

2006
03:49:57,261 --> 03:49:58,261
He's found us.

2007
03:51:27,395 --> 03:51:30,093
Can I help you?

2008
03:51:30,267 --> 03:51:33,749
I'm sure you know Darkseid
is not finished with Earth.

2009
03:51:33,923 --> 03:51:36,926
The Anti-Life Equation
is here somewhere.

2010
03:51:37,100 --> 03:51:39,842
We have to find it
before he does.

2011
03:51:40,016 --> 03:51:41,844
There's a war coming.

2012
03:51:42,018 --> 03:51:43,802
And I'm here to help.

2013
03:51:43,977 --> 03:51:46,196
I'm sorry, who are you again?

2014
03:51:46,370 --> 03:51:48,503
I've gone by many names

2015
03:51:48,677 --> 03:51:51,941
and taken many forms.
And like you,

2016
03:51:52,115 --> 03:51:54,726
I've realized I have
a stake in this world

2017
03:51:54,901 --> 03:51:57,294
and it's time
I started fighting for it.

2018
03:51:58,078 --> 03:51:59,166
Oh.

2019
03:52:00,907 --> 03:52:03,039
Well, we could
definitely use the help.

2020
03:52:03,213 --> 03:52:06,390
So, glad you're here.

2021
03:52:07,696 --> 03:52:08,784
You know, I never thought

2022
03:52:08,958 --> 03:52:09,979
I'd see
the defenders of Earth

2023
03:52:10,003 --> 03:52:13,049
united and fighting as one.

2024
03:52:13,223 --> 03:52:15,530
It wouldn't have happened
without you, Bruce.

2025
03:52:17,053 --> 03:52:19,360
Your mother and father
would be proud.

2026
03:52:20,752 --> 03:52:21,928
I hope so.

2027
03:52:27,977 --> 03:52:30,937
Well, I'll be in touch.

2028
03:52:32,025 --> 03:52:36,029
Oh, and some have called me

2029
03:52:36,203 --> 03:52:38,466
the Martian Manhunter.

2030
03:52:46,213 --> 03:52:48,519
