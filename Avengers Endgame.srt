we smell like garbage.

by not handling it.

next month?

371
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,028
Not likely.

another haircut?

to get their guns off.

right before...

460
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:21,869
Thanos...

461
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,337
| was in a place
called the quantum realm.

462

The quantum realm is like
its own microscopic universe.

463

to be incredibly small.

you've seen,

529
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,717

with the Planck scale...

00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,625
Why didn't we think
of this before?

542
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,249
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

543
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,501
The stones are in the past.

544
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:54,923
We could go back,
we could get them.

545
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,380
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

546
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,465
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

547
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,629
| don't believe we would.

548
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,761
Gotta say it. | sometimes miss
that giddy optimism.

549
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,351
However, high hopes
won't help...

550
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,478
if there's no logical,
tangible way

551
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:12,024
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

552
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,059
| believe
the most likely outcome

553
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,144
will be our collective demise.

554
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,071
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

555
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,903
All right? It means no talking
to our past selves...

556
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,530
no betting on sporting events.

557
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,445
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

558
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,738
Are you seriously telling me

559
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,619
that your plan
to save the universe...

560
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,454
is based on
Back to the Future?

561
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:33,329
-Is it?
-No.

562
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,541
Good. You had me
worried there.

563
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,668
'Cause that would be
horseshit.

564
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,129
That's not how
quantum physics works.

565
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,464
Tony.

566
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,887
We have to take a stand.

567
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,424
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

568
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,057
SCOTT: | know you got
a lot on the line.

569
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,101
You got a wife, a daughter.

570
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,767
But | lost someone
very important to me.

571
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,526
A lotta people did.

572
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,688
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

573
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,027
to bring everyone back,

574
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,607
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

575
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,488
That's right, Scott.
| won't even.

576
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,537
-l can't.

MORGAN STARK: Mommy told me
to come and save you.

579
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,540
Good job. I'm saved.

580
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,335

I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, | just...

583

Oh, look,
the table's set for six.

And I'm happy for you.
| really am.

586

But this is a second chance.

587
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,349
| got my second chance
right here, Cap.

588
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,059
Can't roll the dice on it.

589
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,062
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

Well, he's scared.

SCOTT: Yeah, but, | mean,
what are we gonna do?

593
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,864
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

594
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,780
No, | wanna do it right.

595
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,663
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

596
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,916
Bigger than his?

597
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,214
Come on, | feel like
I'm the only one eating here.

598
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,335
Try some of that.

599
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:01,417
Have some eggs.

600
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,259
I'm so confused.

601
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,087
These are confusing times.

602
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,092
Right, no, no.
That's not what | meant.

Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

Yeah. What? How? Why?

607
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,317
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

608
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,562
Except it was worse for me...

609
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,946
'cause I lost twice.

610
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,902
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

611
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,116
and then, we all lost.

612
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,443
No one blamed you, Bruce.

613
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,986

614
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,990
For years,
I've been treating the Hulk

615
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,199
like he's
some kind of disease...

616
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,750
something to get rid of.

617
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,166
But then, | start looking
at him as the cure.

618
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,874
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

619
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,634
| put the brains
and the brawn together...

620
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,044
and now, look at me.

621
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,429
Best of both worlds.

622
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,515
-Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
-Yes.

623
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,016
Can we get a photo?

624
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,428

-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-SMART HULK: Thanks.

That's a good one.

01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,735
Which means we have to
pick our targets.

1071
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:27,441
Correct.

1072
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,410
So, let's start
with the Aether.

1073
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,786
Thor, what do you know?

1074
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:38,585
NATASHA: Is he asleep?

1075
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,292
RHODES: No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

1076
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,047
Uh, where to start? Um...

1077
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,259
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

1078
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,557
Someone called it
a stone before.

1079
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:57,938
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

1080
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:59,724
SO someone's gonna need
to amend that

1081
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:00,979
and stop saying that.

1082
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,981
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

1083
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,021
My grandfather,
many years ago...

1084
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,692
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

1085
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,569
Ooh. (CHUCKLES) Scary beings.

1086
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,454
So, Jane, actually...

1087
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,577
Oh, there she is.

1088
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:20,411
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

1089
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,627
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1090
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,634
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

1091
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,840
and she became
very, very sick.

1092
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,881
And so | had to
take her to Asgard,

1093
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,136
which is where I'm from...

1094
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,267
and we had to try and fix her.

1095
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,053
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1096
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,598
and | got to introduce her
to my mother...

1097
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,980
(SIGHS) who's dead and, um...

1098
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:46,895
Oh, you know, Jane and |

1099
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,901
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

1100
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:49,982
(MOUTHING)

1101
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,237
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

1102
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:52,700
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

1103
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,619
-Why don't you come sit down?
-I'm not done yet.

1104
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,325
The only thing
that is permanent in life

1105
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,827
is impermanence. (LAUGHS)

1106
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,872
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

1107
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,083
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

1108
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,372

the Power Stone from Morag.

1109
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:09,176
-SMART HULK: Is that a person?
-No, Morag's a planet.

1110
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:11,253
Quill was a person.

1111
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:14,347
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

1112
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,928
Oh, look.

1113
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,727

all happy and everything.

the Soul Stone on Vormir.

1118
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,109

of celestial existence.

Mm... Bleecker Street.

1129
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,184
Wait, he lived in New York?

1130
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:00,806

Six stones, three teams,
one shot.

1139
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:32,960
STEVE: Five years ago,
we lost.

1140
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:35,591
All of us.

1141
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:38,882
We lost friends.

1142
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,263
We lost family.

1143
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:45,063
We lost a part of ourselves.

1144
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:48,858
Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.

1145
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,113
You know your teams.
You know your missions.

1146
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,861
Get the stones. Get them back.

1147

somewhere we know.

we should know what to expect.

1939
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:51,389
Daughter of Ivan.

1940
01:48:52,735 --> 01:48:53,850
Clint.

1941
01:48:54,028 --> 01:48:56,315
Son of Edith.

1942
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:03,158
Who are you?

1943
01:49:03,787 --> 01:49:06,245
Consider me a guide...

1944
01:49:06,415 --> 01:49:08,076
to you...

1945
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:10,082
and to all who seek
the Soul Stone.

1946
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:11,287
Oh, good.

1947
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:13,578
You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

1948
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:15,997
(SPEAKS GERMAN)

1949
01:49:17,509 --> 01:49:19,750
If only it were that easy.

1950
01:49:31,857 --> 01:49:35,566
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1951
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:39,232
As does what you fear.

1952
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:46,027
The stone's down there.

1953
01:49:46,663 --> 01:49:48,574
RED SKULL: For one of you.

1954
01:49:48,874 --> 01:49:50,581
For the other...

1955
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:55,164
In order to take the stone...

1956
01:49:55,339 --> 01:49:58,331
you must lose
that which you love.

1957
01:49:59,718 --> 01:50:02,881
An everlasting exchange.

1958
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:07,974
A soul for a soul.

1959
01:50:10,562 --> 01:50:13,145
BARTON: How's it going?
(CHUCKLES)

1960
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:16,770
Jesus.

1961
01:50:17,111 --> 01:50:18,818
Maybe he's making
this shit up.

1962
01:50:19,696 --> 01:50:21,027
No.

1963
01:50:21,865 --> 01:50:22,855
| don't think so.

1964
01:50:23,575 --> 01:50:25,737
Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

1965
01:50:27,246 --> 01:50:28,281
| didn't.

1966
01:50:29,790 --> 01:50:32,157
Thanos left here
with the stone...

1967
01:50:32,835 --> 01:50:34,371
without his daughter.

1968
01:50:34,545 --> 01:50:36,627
That's not a coincidence.

1969
01:50:37,714 --> 01:50:39,330
Yeah.

1970
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:42,917
Whatever it takes.

1971
01:50:47,432 --> 01:50:48,922
Whatever it takes.

1972
01:50:53,313 --> 01:50:55,270
If we don't get that stone...

1973
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:57,101
billions of people stay dead.

1974
01:50:57,985 --> 01:50:59,146
Yeah.

1975
01:51:01,029 --> 01:51:03,145
Then | guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1976
01:51:03,907 --> 01:51:05,068
| guess we do.

1977
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,616
I'm starting to think we mean

1978
01:51:15,711 --> 01:51:18,203
different people here,
Natasha.

1979
01:51:18,714 --> 01:51:20,546
For the last five years, I've
been trying to do one thing.

1980
01:51:20,716 --> 01:51:21,956
Get to right here.

1981
01:51:22,134 --> 01:51:24,125
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1982
01:51:24,303 --> 01:51:26,510
No, don't you get
all decent on me now.

1983
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,671
What, you think | wanna do it?

1984
01:51:29,266 --> 01:51:31,007
I'm trying to save your life,
you idiot.

1985
01:51:31,185 --> 01:51:33,517
Yeah, well, | don't
want you to. How's that?

1986
01:51:34,438 --> 01:51:36,645
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

1987
01:51:38,317 --> 01:51:40,103
You know what I've become.

1988
01:51:42,237 --> 01:51:44,820
Oh, I don't judge people
on their worst mistakes.

1989
01:51:48,994 --> 01:51:50,234
Maybe you should.

1990
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:52,657
You didn't.

1991
01:51:58,837 --> 01:52:01,044
You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?

1992
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:13,348
Okay.

1993
01:52:15,103 --> 01:52:16,593

Wait.

2004
01:53:19,584 --> 01:53:21,416
Let me go.

2005
01:53:22,671 --> 01:53:23,661
No.

2006
01:53:25,424 --> 01:53:26,414
No. Please, no.

2007
01:53:29,803 --> 01:53:31,635
It's okay.

2008
01:53:33,682 --> 01:53:34,672
Please.

this actually worked?

Yeah.

01:56:02,247 --> 01:56:03,237
Us.

Huh?

-What are you doing?
-Just asked him a question.

2022
01:56:09,004 --> 01:56:10,244
Yeah, no, you're acting
like she's dead.

2023
01:56:10,422 --> 01:56:11,537
Why are we acting
like she's dead?

2024
01:56:11,631 --> 01:56:12,871
We have the stones, right?

2025

As long as we have
the stones...

2026
01:56:14,217 --> 01:56:15,958
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

2027
01:56:16,136 --> 01:56:18,127
So, stop this shit. We're the
Avengers. Get it together.

but you're a very
earthly being, okay?

2035
01:56:33,236 --> 01:56:34,522
And we're talking
about space magic.

2036

definitive. Don't you think?

who's gonna put that on yet.

I'm sorry. What,
we're all just sitting around

waiting for
the right opportunity?

2065
01:58:14,254 --> 01:58:15,369
We should at least discuss it.

2066
01:58:15,547 --> 01:58:17,504
Look, sitting here
staring at the thing

2067
01:58:17,591 --> 01:58:19,377
is not gonna bring
everybody back.

just the fact...

that that glove is channeling
enough energy
